      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    </p><p>
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
      to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
      convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
      the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    </p><p>
      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;    &lt;name of author&gt;
    </p><p>
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
    </p><p>
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
    </p><p>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    </p><p>
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    </p><p>
      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
      when it starts in an interactive mode:
    </p><p>
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    </p><p>
      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
      parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
      be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
      mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    </p><p>
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
      school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
      necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    </p><p>
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    </p><p>
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    </p><p>
      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
      proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
      consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
      library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
      Public License instead of this License.
