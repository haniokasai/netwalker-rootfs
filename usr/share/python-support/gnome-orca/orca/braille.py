"""A very experimental approach to the refreshable Braille display.  This
module treats each line of the display as a sequential set of regions, where
each region can potentially backed by an Accessible object.  Depending upon
the Accessible object, the cursor routing keys can be used to perform
operations on the Accessible object, such as invoking default actions or
moving the text caret.
