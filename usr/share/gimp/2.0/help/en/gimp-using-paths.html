    Paths are curves (known as Bézier-curves). In <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> it's
    very easy to learn and to use them. To understand their concepts and
    mechanism you can go to the glossary
    <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-bezier-curve" title="Bezier curve">Bézier-curve</a> or to Wikipedia
    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve" target="_top">
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve</a>. It is a very powerful
    tool to design sophisticated forms. To use it in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
    you must operate by two successive ways: 1st Create the path and 2nd
    Stroke path.
  </p>
      <p>
    According to the terminology used in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>,
    “<span class="quote">Stroke path</span>” means here to apply a specific style to the
    path (color, width, pattern... ).
  </p>
      <p>
    Paths are used for two main purposes:

          <li>
            <p>
        An open or closed path can be <span class="emphasis"><em>stroked</em></span>,

      At this step you can design a skeleton of wished form; this skeleton
      will be modified later by various ways. To do this you can go to
      <a class="link" href="gimp-tools-other.html#gimp-tool-path" title="6.1.  Path">Paths</a>.
      A short example will be useful to understand the creating process.

      Your pointer changes into a pen feature with a curve beginning; if you
      click in the image you print a point (white inner circle with a
      black border); moving mouse and right-clicking again you create
      automatically a second point linked to previous one. You can carry on as
      often as you wish it to design a polyline, but to learn you need two
      points only. Now if you approach pointer close to segment ranging
      between the two points, the little “<span class="quote">+</span>”
      close to pointer changes into a cross (for moving). Now press down right
      button moving pointer to any side.
    </p>
        <p>
      Then two events occur. One is a bending of the segment to the moving
      direction and this bending is proportional to displacement. The
      second reveals two segments ended with squares (named handles) at the
      two curve ends . If you place the mouse pointer on these squares it
      changes into a pointing finger. Now, if you click-and-drag you can see
      the consequence on the curve feature. By this mean you can change the
      starting curve orientation as well as its “<span class="quote">lengthening</span>”
      on modified side.

      Paths can be created and manipulated using the
      <a class="link" href="gimp-tools-other.html#gimp-tool-path" title="6.1.  Path">Path tool</a>.
      Paths, like layers and channels, are components of an image. When an
      image is saved in GIMP's native XCF file format, any paths it has are
      saved along with it. The list of paths in an image can be viewed and
      operated on using the
      <a class="link" href="gimp-path-dialog.html" title="2.3.  Path Dialog">Paths dialog</a>.
      If you want to move a path from one image to another, you can do so by
      copying and pasting using the pop-up menu in the Paths dialog, or by
      dragging an icon from the Paths dialog into the destination image's
      window.
    </p>
        <p>
      GIMP paths belong to a mathematical type called
      “<span class="quote">Bezier paths</span>”. What this means in practical terms is that
      they are defined by <span class="emphasis"><em>anchors</em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>handles</em></span>. “<span class="quote">Anchors</span>” are points the path
      goes through. “<span class="quote">Handles</span>” define the direction of a path when
      it enters or leaves an anchor point: each anchor point has two handles
      attached to it.
    </p>
        <p>
      Paths can be very complex. If you create them by hand using the Path
      tool, unless you are obsessive they probably won't contain more than a
      few dozen anchor points (often many fewer); but if you create them by
      transforming a selection into a path, or by transforming text into a
      path, the result can easily contain hundreds of anchor points, or even
      thousands.
    </p>
        <p>
      A path may contain multiple <span class="emphasis"><em>components</em></span>. A
      “<span class="quote">component</span>”
      is a part of a path whose anchor points are all connected to each other
      by path segments. The ability to have multiple components in paths
      allows you to convert them into selections having multiple disconnected
      parts.
    </p>
        <p>
      Each component of a path can be either <span class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span> or
      <span class="emphasis"><em>closed</em></span>: “<span class="quote">closed</span>”
      means that the last anchor point is connected to the first anchor point.
      If you transform a path into a selection, any open components are
      automatically converted into closed components by connecting the last
      anchor point to the first anchor point with a straight line.
    </p>
        <p>
      Path segments can be either straight or curved. A path all of whose
      segments are straight is called “<span class="quote">polygonal</span>”.
      When you create a path segment, it starts out straight, because the
      handles for the anchor points are initially placed directly on top of
      the anchor points, yielding handles of zero length, which produce
      straight-line segments. You can make a segment curved by dragging a
      handle away from one of the anchor points.
    </p>
        <p>
      One nice thing about paths is that they are very light in terms of
      resource consumption, especially in comparison with images. Representing
      a path in RAM only requires storing the coordinates of its anchors and
      handles: 1K of memory is enough to hold quite a complex path, but not
      enough to hold even a 20x20 pixel RGB layer. Therefore, it is quite
      possible to have literally hundreds of paths in an image without putting
      any significant stress of your system. (How much stress managing them
      would put on <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
      is, of course, another question.) Even a path with thousands of segments
      consumes minimal resources in comparison to a typical layer or channel.
