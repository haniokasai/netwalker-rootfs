      As with anything else, images come in different kinds and serve
      different purposes. Sometimes, a small size is important (for web sites)
      and at other times, retaining a high colour depth in all its glory (a
      family portrait) is what you want. GIMP can handle all of this, and
      more, primarily by converting between three fundamental modes, as seen
      in this menu. In order to switch your image to one of these modes, you
      open it and follow that menu and click the mode you want.
    </p>
      <p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>RGB</em></span>
      - This is the default mode, used for high quality rich colour images.
      This is also the mode to do most of your image work with including
      scaling, cropping and even flipping as it gives the computer more
      information to work with. This extra information also makes RGB Mode the
      largest to store as a result.
    </p>
      <p>
      A little bit of detail if you are interested. Each pixel or point when
      in this mode consists of three different components. R-&gt;Red, G-&gt;Green,
      B-&gt;Blue. Each of these in turn can have an intensity value of 0-255. So,
      at every pixel, what you see is an additive combination of these three
      components. All these combinations result in a way to represent millions
      of colours.
    </p>
      <p>
      As an example to practice with images have been provided in various
      sizes and formats. Indexed images of different sizes: from a very old
      APOD a small gif and a larger gif of the same image from a later APOD.
      Also the same image in RGB as provided by Earth Observatory a smaller
      version and a huge version.
    </p>
      <p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Indexed</em></span>
      - This is the mode usually used when file size is of concern, or when
      you are working with images with few colours. It involves using a fixed
      number of colours, 256 or less, at each point to represent the colour at
      that point. The defaults to attempting to figure out an "optimum
      palette" to best represent your image. Try it, you can undo it if you
      don't like the results, or use a custom palette or more colours.
    </p>

        <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">

      <p>
      As you might expect, since the information needed to represent the
      colour at each pixel is less, the file size is a lot smaller. However,
      sometimes, there will be options in the various menus that seem to have
      been "greyed" out for no apparent reason. This usually means the filter
      or option cannot be applied when your image is in its current mode.
      Changing the mode to RGB as outlined above should solve this issue. If
      that doesn't work either, perhaps the option you're trying requires your
      layer to have the ability to be transparent. This can be done just as
      easily via (Image)-&gt;Layer-&gt;Transparency-&gt;Add Alpha Channel.

      <p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Grayscale</em></span>
      - In case you want to convert your brilliant colour image to something
      that's black and white (with a lot of shades of grey), this is one of
      the easiest ways in which to do it. Some photos do look a lot fancier
      when displayed in grayscale. Again, if you're interested in some detail,
      this is achieved by taking the RGB values at the pixels in your image,
      and suitably weighted averaging them to get an intensity at that point.
    </p>
      <p>
      There is no need to convert an image to a specific mode before saving it
      in your favourite format, as GIMP is smart enough to export.
