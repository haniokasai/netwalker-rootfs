    This section is intended to give you a brief introduction to the basic
    concepts and terminology you will need to understand in order to make
    sense of the rest of the documentation. Everything here is explained in
    much greater depth elsewhere. With a few exceptions, we have avoided
    cluttering this section with a lot of links and cross-references:
    everything mentioned here is so high-level that you should easily be able
    to locate it in the index.

              <p>
          Images are the basic entities that <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> works
          with. Roughly speaking, an “<span class="quote">image</span>” corresponds to a
          single file, such as a TIFF or JPEG file. You can also think of an
          image as corresponding to a single display window, but this is not
          quite correct: it is possible to have multiple windows all
          displaying the same image. It is not possible to have a single
          window display more than one image, though, or for an image to have
          no window displaying it.
        </p>
              <p>
          A <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> image may be quite a complicated thing.
          Instead of thinking of it as something like a sheet of paper with a
          picture on it, you should think of it as more like a book, whose
          pages are called “<span class="quote">layers</span>” In addition to a stack of
          layers, a <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> image may contain a selection
          mask, a set of channels, and a set of paths. In fact,
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> provides a mechanism for attaching arbitrary
          pieces of data to an image, as which are called
          “<span class="quote">parasites</span>”
        </p>
              <p>
          In <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, it is possible to have many images open
          at the same time. If they are large, each image may use many
          megabytes of memory, but <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses a
          sophisticated tile-based memory management system that allows it to
          handle even very large images gracefully.  There are, however,
          limits, and it is usually beneficial when working with images to put
          as much memory into your system as possible.
        </p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
          If an image is like a book, then a layer is like a page within the
          book. The simplest images only contain a single layer, and can be
          treated like single sheets of paper, but sophisticated
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> users often deal with images containing many
          layers, even dozens of them.  Layers need not be opaque, and they
          need not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an
          image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may
          see elements of many layers.

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
          In <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> Channels are the smallest units of
          subdivision in the stack of layers from which the image is
          constructed. Every Channel in a layer has exactly the same size as
          the layer it belongs to and consequently consists of the same
          pixels. Every pixel can be regarded as a container which can be
          filled with a value ranging from 0 to 255. The exact meaning of this
          value depends on the type of channel, e.g. in the
          <acronym class="acronym">RGB</acronym> color model the value in the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>-channel means the amount of red which is
          added to the colour of the different pixels, in the selection
          channel the value denotes how strong the pixels are selected and in
          the alpha channel the values denote how transparent the
          corresponding pixels are.

            <dd>
              <p>
          Often when you do something to an image, you only want a part of it
          to be affected. The “<span class="quote">selection</span>”
          mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection,
          which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the
          selected parts from the unselected parts (the so-called
          “<span class="quote">marching ants</span>” ). Actually this is a bit misleading:
          selection in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          is really graded, not all-or-nothing, and really the selection is
          represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel. The dashed line
          that you normally see is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected
          level. At any time, though, you can visualize the selection channel
          in all its glorious detail by toggling the
          <a class="link" href="gimp-image-window-qmask-button.html" title="3.  QuickMask">QuickMask</a>
          button.
        </p>
              <p>
          A large component of learning how to use <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          effectively is acquiring the art of making good
          selections—selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing
          more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important,
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> gives you a large number of tools for doing
          it: an assortment of selection-making tools, a menu of selection
          operations, and the ability to switch to Quick Mask mode, in which
          you can treat the selection channel as though it were a color
          channel, thereby “<span class="quote">painting the selection</span>”

            <dd>
              <p>
          When you make mistakes, you can undo them. Nearly everything you can
          do to an image is undoable. In fact, you can usually undo a
          substantial number of the most recent things you did, if you decide
          that they were misguided. <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> makes this
          possible by keeping a history of your actions. This history consumes
          memory, though, so undoability is not infinite. Some actions use
          very little undo memory, so that you can do dozens of them before
          the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other types of
          actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure
          the amount of memory <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> allows for the undo
          history of each image, but in any situation, you should always be
          able to undo at least your 2-3 most recent actions. (The most
          important action that is not undoable is closing an image. For this
          reason, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> asks you to confirm that you really
          want to close the image if you have made any changes to it.)

              <p>
          Many, probably most, of the things you do to an image in
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> are done by the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          application itself. However, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> also makes
          extensive use of “<span class="quote">plug-ins</span>” which are external programs
          that interact very closely with <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, and are
          capable of manipulating images and other <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          objects in very sophisticated ways. Many important plug-ins come
          packaged together with <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, but there are also
          many available by other means. In fact, the ability to write
          plug-ins (and scripts) is the easiest way for people not on the
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> development team to add new capabilities to
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.
        </p>
              <p>
          All of the commands in the Filters menu, and a substantial number of
          commands in other menus, are actually implemented by plug-ins.
        </p>

            <dd>
              <p>
          In addition to plug-ins, which are programs written in the C
          language, GIMP can also make use of scripts. The largest number of
          existing scripts are written in a language called Script-Fu, which
          is special to GIMP (for those who care, it is a dialect of the
          Lisp-like language called Scheme). It is also possible to write GIMP
          scripts in Python or Perl. These languages are more flexible and
          powerful than Script-Fu; their disadvantage is that they depend on
          software that does not automatically come packaged with GIMP, so
          they are not guaranteed to work correctly in every GIMP
          installation.
