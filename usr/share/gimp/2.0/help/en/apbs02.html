      Okay, so you have done everything you could to make sure, and you still
      think it's probably a bug. You should then go ahead and file a bug
      report. To do this, begin by going to
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi, and go down the page until you
      can select the component “<span class="quote">GIMP</span>”.
    </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Note">
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
              <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />

        The first time you file a bug report, you will be asked to create a
        Bugzilla account. The process is easy and painless, and you probably
        won't even get any spam as a result.
      </p>

      This takes you to the bug report form, which you should fill out
      as follows.  Note that most of the information you enter can be
      changed later by the developers if you get it wrong, so try to get
      it right but don't be obsessive about it.
    </p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Summary</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            Give a one-sentence summary that is descriptive enough so that
            somebody searching for similar bugs would find your bug report on
            the basis of the words this summary contains.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Steps to reproduce the bug</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            Follow the directions. Be as specific as you can, and include all
            information that you think might possibly be relevant. The classic
            totally useless bug report is,
            “<span class="quote">GIMP crashes. This program sucks</span>”.
            There is no hope that the developers can solve a problem if they
            can't tell what it is. If at all possible, give a procedure that
            will reliably reproduce the buggy behavior, and give it in enough
            detail so that a moron could follow it.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Component</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            Set this to the part of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> that the bug
            affects. You have to pick something here, but if you aren't
            sure, make a guess and don't worry about it.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Severity</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            In most cases you should either leave this as
            “<span class="quote">Normal</span>” or set it to “<span class="quote">Enhancement</span>”,
            if it is an enhancement request rather than a
            malfunction. The maintainers will adjust the severity if they
            think it is warranted.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Priority</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            In most cases you should leave this at “<span class="quote">Normal</span>”,
            and allow the maintainers to adjust it. Setting the priority to
            “<span class="quote">Immediate</span>” or “<span class="quote">Urgent</span>” usually just
            manages to annoy people.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Version</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            Set this to the version of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> that you are
            using. Leave the Gnome version unspecified.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Operating System</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            Set this to your OS unless you have a very good reason for
            thinking that the bug applies to all operating systems.
          </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>
      You can ignore the rest. When you have filled out all of these things,
      press the “<span class="quote">Commit</span>” button and your bug report will be
      submitted. It will
      be assigned a number, which you may want to make note of; you will,
      however, be emailed any time somebody makes a comment on your bug report
      or otherwise alters it, so you will receive reminders in any case. You
      can see the current state of your bug report at any time by going to
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org and, at the bottom of the page, in the
      “<span class="quote">Actions:</span>” area, entering the bug number and pressing
      the “<span class="quote">Find</span>” button.
    </p>
      <p>
      Sometimes it is very helpful to augment a bug report with a screenshot
      or some other type of data. If you need to do this, go to the web page
      for your bug report, click on the link
      “<span class="quote">Create a New Attachment</span>”, and
      follow the directions. But please don't do this unless you think the
      attachment is really going to be useful–and if you need to attach a
      screenshot, don't make it any larger than necessary. Bug reports are
      likely to remain on the system for years, so there is no sense in
      wasting memory.
