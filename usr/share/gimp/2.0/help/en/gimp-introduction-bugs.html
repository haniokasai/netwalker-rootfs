    Sad to say, no version of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
    has yet been absolutely perfect. Even sadder, it is likely that no version
    ever will be. In spite of all efforts to make everything work, a program
    as complicated as <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
    is bound to screw things up occasionally, or even crash.
  </p>
      <p>
    But the fact that bugs are unavoidable does not mean that they should be
    passively accepted. If you find a bug in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, the
    developers would like to know about it so they can at least try to fix it.
  </p>
      <p>
    Suppose, then, that you have found a bug, or at least think you have: you
    try to do something, and the results are not what you expect. What should
    you do? How should you report it?
  </p>
      <div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Tip">
          <tr>

      The procedure for making an <span class="emphasis"><em>enhancement
      request</em></span>–that is, for asking the developers to add a
      missing feature–is nearly the same as the procedure for
      reporting a bug.  The only thing you do differently is to mark the
      report as an “<span class="quote">enhancement</span>” at the appropriate stage, as
      described below.

    In common with many other free software projects,
    <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses a bug-reporting mechanism called
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Bugzilla</em></span>.
    This is a very powerful web-based system, capable of managing thousands
    of bug reports without losing track. In fact, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
    shares its Bugzilla database with the entire Gnome project. At the time
    this is being written, Gnome Bugzilla contains 148632 bug reports–no, make
    that 148633.
  </p>
      <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>

      The first thing you should do, before reporting a bug, is to make
      an effort to verify that what you are seeing really
      <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a bug.  It is hard to give a method for
      doing this that applies to all situations, but reading the
      documentation will often be useful, and discussing the question on
      IRC or a mailing list may also be quite helpful.  If you are
      seeing a <span class="emphasis"><em>crash</em></span>, as opposed to mere
      misbehavior, the odds that it is a true bug are pretty high: well
      written software programs are not designed to crash under
      <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> circumstances.  In any case, if you have
      made an conscientious effort to decide whether it is really a bug,
      and at the end still aren't sure, then please go ahead and report
      it:  the worst that can happen is that you will waste a bit of
      time for the development team.
    </p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <table border="0" summary="Note">
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
                <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
              </td>
              <th align="left">Note</th>

        Actually there are a few things that are known to cause
        <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> to
        crash but have turned out to be too inconvenient to be worth
        fixing.  One of them is asking <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> to do
        something that requires vast amounts of memory, such as creating an
        image one million pixels on a side.
      </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>
      You should also make sure that you are using an up-to-date version
      of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>: reporting bugs that have already been
      fixed is just a waste of everybody's time.  (<acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 1
      is no longer maintained, so if you use it and find bugs, either
      upgrade to <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 2 or live with
      them.)  Particularly if you are using the development version of
      <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, make sure that you can see the bug in the
      latest release before filing a report.
    </p>
        <p>
      If after due consideration you still think you have a legitimate
      bug report or enhancement request, the next step is to go to
      <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>'s bugzilla query page
      (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/query.cgi),
      and try to see whether somebody else has already reported the same
      thing.  The query page allows you to search the bug database in a
      variety of ways.  Unfortunately this page is a bit more
      complicated to use than it really ought to be, but here is
      basically what you should do:
    </p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">Summary:</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
            Set this to “<span class="quote">contains any of the words/strings</span>”.
          </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">(the adjoining entry area)</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
            Give one or more words that somebody would be likely to use in
            writing a one-sentence summary of a bug similar to yours. For
            example, if the problem is that zooming too much causes
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> to
            crash, the word “<span class="quote">zoom</span>” would be good.
          </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">Product:</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Set this to “<span class="quote">GIMP</span>”</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">Component:, Version:, Target:</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Don't do anything for these.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">Text information:</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
            For now, leave this alone. If your search does not turn up
            anything, it might be worth entering your search terms in the
            “<span class="quote">comment</span>” area here, but this often turns out to
            give you either great masses of stuff or nothing.
          </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">Status:</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
            This field encodes the status of a bug report: whether it is still
            open, has been resolved, etc. You want to see all relevant bug
            reports, regardless of status, so you should hold down the mouse
            and sweep it across all entries. Leaving it alone will not work.
          </p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>
      When you have set these things up, click on the “<span class="quote">Search</span>”
      button at
      either the top or bottom; they both do the same thing. The result is
      either a list of bug reports–hopefully not too long–or a message saying
      “<span class="quote">Zarro boogs found</span>”. If you don't find a related bug
      report by doing
      this, it may be worth trying another search with different terms. If in
      spite of your best efforts, you file a bug report and it ends up being
      resolved as “<span class="quote">Duplicate</span>”, don't be too upset: it has
      happened repeatedly to the author of this documentation, who works with
      <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> Bugzilla nearly every day.
