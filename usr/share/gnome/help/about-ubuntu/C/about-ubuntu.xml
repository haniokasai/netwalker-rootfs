		<para>Ubuntu is an entirely open source operating system built around the 
		  <emphasis>Linux</emphasis> kernel. The Ubuntu community is built around the ideals enshrined in the <ulink url="&ubuntu-philosophy;">Ubuntu Philosophy</ulink>: that software should be
                available free of charge, that software tools should be usable
                by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
                and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
                their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons:

							<para>Ubuntu is a South African ethical ideology focusing on
                        people&apos;s allegiances and relations with each other. The
                        word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu
                        is seen as a
                        traditional African concept, is regarded as one of the
                        founding principles of the new republic of South Africa
                        and is connected to the idea of an African Renaissance.
							</para>
							<para>A rough translation of the principle of Ubuntu is
                        &quot;humanity towards others&quot;. Another
                        translation could be: &quot;the belief in a
                        universal bond of sharing that connects all
                        humanity&quot;.

                    <para>&quot;Free software&quot; doesn't mean that you shouldn&apos;t have to pay for it (although Ubuntu is committed to being free of charge as well). It means that you should be able to use the software in any way you wish: the code that makes up free software is available for anyone to download, change, fix, and use in any way. Alongside ideological benefits, this freedom also has technical advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work of others can be used and built upon. With non-free software, this cannot happen and when programs are developed, they have to start from scratch. For this reason the development of free software is fast, efficient and exciting!

                    	<para>There are many different operating systems based on Linux:
 	                 Debian, SuSE, Gentoo, Red Hat, and Mandriva are examples. 
			   Ubuntu is yet another contender in what
                        is already a highly competitive world. So what makes
                        Ubuntu different?
							</para>
                    	<para>Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed,
                        technologically advanced, and well-supported
                        distributions, Ubuntu
                        aims to create a distribution that provides
                        an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for desktop and
                        server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of carefully
                        selected packages from the Debian distribution and
                        retains its powerful package management system which
                        allows easy installation and clean removal of programs. Unlike most
                        distributions that ship with a large amount of software
                        that may or may not be of use, Ubuntu&apos;s list of packages
                        is reduced to a number of important applications of high
                        quality.
							</para>
                    	<para>By focusing on quality, Ubuntu produces a robust and
                        feature-rich computing environment that is suitable for
                        use in both home and commercial environments. The
                        project takes the time required to focus on finer
                        details and is able to release a version featuring the
                        latest and greatest of today&apos;s software once every 6
                        months. Ubuntu is available in 32-bit and 64-bit flavors, 
                        and will run on most modern computers. It is also available 
                        for the Sun UltraSPARC and Amazon EC2 architectures.

<title>How can I upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu?</title>
<para>
A new version of Ubuntu is released every 6 months; the Update Manager should 
inform you when a new version is available for download. To check for a new 
version:
</para>

<procedure>
    <step>
    <para>
    Open Software Sources (&software-properties;) and select the 
    <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab.
    </para>
    </step>
    <step>
    <para>
    Under <guilabel>Release upgrade</guilabel>, make sure that 
    <guilabel>Normal releases</guilabel> is selected and click 
    <guibutton>Close</guibutton>.
    </para>
    </step>
    <step>
    <para>
    Open the Update Manager (&update-manager;), click 
    <guibutton>Check</guibutton> and enter your password if prompted. Wait for 
    the list of available updates to be downloaded.
    </para>
    </step>
    <step>
    <para>
    If a new version of Ubuntu is available, a box at the top of the window 
    will appear saying that a new distribution release is available.
    </para>
    </step>
    <step>
    <para>
    To upgrade to the latest release, save all of your open documents and click 
    the <guibutton>Upgrade</guibutton> button in the Update Manager.
    </para>
    </step>
</procedure>

<para>
Upgrades usually take a while to complete. Typically, around 700MB of packages 
must be downloaded and installed, although the actual figure will depend on how 
many packages are already installed on your computer.
</para>

<para>
You can only upgrade to the latest Ubuntu release if you are running the second 
most recent release. If you have an older release, you must upgrade to the next 
release after that, and so on until you are running the most recent version. 
For example, users of version 7.10 would first have to upgrade to version 8.04 
before upgrading to version 8.10. An exception to this rule is with LTS (Long 
Term Support) releases. You can upgrade directly from the previous LTS release 
to the current release.
</para>

<sect2 id="upgrade-development" status="review">
    <title>Upgrading to a development release</title>
    <para>
    If you would like to install and test the latest development version of 
    Ubuntu before it is released, press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap>
    <keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>, type 
    <userinput>update-manager -c -d</userinput> into the box and click

    it to upgrade to the development version.
    </para>

    <caution>
    <para>
    Development releases often suffer from package breakages and other 
    problems. Only install a development release if you are prepared to attempt 
    to fix these problems for yourself.
