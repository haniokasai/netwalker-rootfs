	<title>Preparing to switch</title>
	<para>While using Windows you will have probably stored a great deal of data, including documents, emails, photographs and music. The chances are that you will want to keep most of this information for use with Ubuntu. This section provides instructions on moving your data to Ubuntu.</para>

		<title>Converting unsupported file types</title>
		<para>While applications available for Ubuntu support most common file types, there are still many file types which are not supported. If you have files in an unsupported format, it is recommended that you try to convert them to a supported format before switching. This section covers some common, unsupported or only partially-supported file types and lists possible alternatives and methods of conversion.</para>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>Many common audio formats cannot be played on Ubuntu without the installation of additional software. This is due to legal restrictions.</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions and technical issues with some common audio formats, Ubuntu cannot play certain audio formats out-of-the-box. While support for certain restricted formats can be added after you have installed Ubuntu, it can be advantageous to convert audio files to a well-supported format. This is especially important if the files have been encoded using some form of <emphasis>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</emphasis> software, as DRM restrictions can render files unplayable in all applications but the one in which they were applied.</para>
			<para>The following major audio formats are proprietary and so are not supported by default in Ubuntu:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>MP3</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>WMA</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>AAC</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>RealAudio</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>For a well-supported audio format to replace MP3 and WMA, consider the <emphasis>Ogg Vorbis</emphasis> format. For a well-supported lossless (very high quality) format to replace AAC Lossless and WMA-VBR, consider the <emphasis>FLAC</emphasis> format. Both of these formats are open, and can be played in Ubuntu without the installation of any additional software.</para>
			<para>There are many audio conversion applications for Windows available for download, and some of these can be obtained free of charge. These applications are also sometimes referred to as <emphasis>audio (re)encoders</emphasis>. Your choice of application depends on the formats which you wish to convert from and to. See websites such as <ulink url="http://www.download.com/Rippers-Encoders/3150-2140_4-0.html?tag=dir">Download.com</ulink> for a list of potentially useful applications.</para>
			<para>It is still possible to add support for many restricted formats (such as those listed above) to Ubuntu after installation. See the <ulink url="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats">Restricted Formats</ulink> document on the Ubuntu community support website for more information.</para>

			</itemizedlist>
			<para>As with audio formats, due to legal and technical issues, many video formats are not supported by the default Ubuntu install. While support for some formats can be added at a later date, it is recommended that you convert important video files in unsupported formats to a format which is well supported in Ubuntu.</para>
			<para>As with the audio formats, there are many video converter applications available as free-of-charge downloads for Windows. Consider converting your video files to a format which is well-supported by Ubuntu, such as <emphasis>Ogg Theora</emphasis>.</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>Ubuntu office applications can read most common office document formats without the need for conversion</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>The default office suite of Ubuntu, <application>OpenOffice.org</application>, supports very many office document formats right out of the box. These include many of the Microsoft Office, Corel and Lotus formats. If you find that you do have files in formats which are unsupported, it is likely that your existing office suite or application will have the ability to save the files to a better-supported format.</para>
			<para>The OpenDocument file formats are gaining popularity and are expected to become the de facto supported office formats for Ubuntu. While many older applications cannot save to the OpenDocument format, other formats such as .doc and RTF are also well supported.</para>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>Some file formats are specific to particular Windows-only applications, and so cannot be used with Ubuntu software</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Many applications use file formats specific to them. A good example is the <application>Adobe Photoshop</application> file format. Formats such as these are generally able to store additional data compared to widely-used standard formats and so are still useful. You may find that applications exist on Ubuntu to convert or use application specific formats. The <application>GIMP Image Editor</application> is able to use Adobe PSD files, for example.</para>

		<title>Transferring your data safely</title>
		<para>Once you have collected together all of the files and settings you might need, you must create a copy of them which can be stored safely while you initially install Ubuntu. There are many ways of storing a copy of this data, and which method you choose will depend on your particular circumstances.</para>
		<caution>
			<para>After you have made a copy of your files, it is very important to <emphasis role='strong'>test the files</emphasis> to ensure that they have been copied successfully. If you have many files, at least check the most important files and randomly check other files where possible. This will help to protect you from data loss.</para>

			<title>Direct transfer</title>
			<para>If you are installing Ubuntu onto a different computer than the one on which your data is stored, you can leave the data you collected on that computer and can safely transfer the data across once Ubuntu has been installed onto the other computer.</para>
			<para>When ready, you can transfer the data between the computers using a network connection.</para>

			<title>CD or DVD disc</title>
			<para>A common and reliable way of backing-up data is by using a recordable CD or DVD disc. CDs and DVDs can be used by almost all computers and are relatively cheap. However, your computer must have a CD or DVD recorder drive installed and you may have to use several CDs or DVDs if the data you have collected is larger than the capacity of a single disc.</para>
			<para>If possible, use DVD discs as these have a larger capacity and so you will require fewer discs to store all of your data. CDs typically have a capacity of 650-700MB while DVDs can normally hold up to 4.5GB of data (roughly equivalent to 7 CDs).</para>
			<para>In order to store data on a blank CD or DVD, you must use a <emphasis>CD writing</emphasis> application. Microsoft Windows XP includes such an application by default, although other such applications are capable of storing your data just as well.</para>

				<listitem><para>Select as many files as you are able to fit onto the disc which you will be using. You can check the size of the current selection by right-clicking any selected file and choosing <guilabel>Properties</guilabel> from the menu which appears. The <guilabel>Size</guilabel> field on the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab gives the size of the current selection.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Copy the selected files into the CD- or DVD-drive folder which you opened earlier.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Press <guibutton>Write these files to CD</guibutton>, which can be found in the blue panel. The <application>CD Writing Wizard</application> will start.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Follow the instructions given on-screen by the <application>CD Writing Wizard</application>. This will write the selected files to a blank CD or DVD.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Once the disc has been written, eject it and then re-insert it into the drive. In <filename>My Computer</filename>, open the drive and check that the files you just copied to the CD are visible there. Try opening a few of them just to make sure.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Repeat this procedure until all of the files you collected together are safely stored onto CDs or DVDs.</para></listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>Once you have stored your data onto discs, ensure that the discs are well protected and labelled correctly. If you scratch or otherwise damage a disc, you may lose some of the data stored on it. Labelling discs also helps to avoid confusion and will allow you to quickly find data when the time comes to transfer it back onto a computer.</para>

			<title>External hard-disk drive or other removable device</title>
			<para>If you have access to an external hard-disk drive or some other removable storage device of a great enough capacity, then you can simply copy the files you have collected onto this device. When ready to transfer the files onto your Ubuntu installation, you may simply connect the drive and copy the files from it again.</para>
			<para>Removable storage devices such as external hard disks will have a certain type of <emphasis>file system</emphasis>. For use on removable devices, the best supported filesystem for Ubuntu is <emphasis>FAT</emphasis> (also called <emphasis>FAT32</emphasis> or <emphasis>vfat</emphasis>). While other file systems (such as NTFS and HFS+) are usable, they may require additional steps to allow you to use them with Ubuntu. If possible, try to use the FAT format for your removable disk.</para>
			<para>You can discover the format of an external disk by right-clicking it in <filename>My Computer</filename> and selecting <guilabel>Properties</guilabel>. The format of the disk is shown in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab under <guilabel>File system</guilabel>.</para>
