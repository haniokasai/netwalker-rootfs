            The Encryption Applet operates on both the Ctrl-C/V and the select/middle click clipboards.  
            Simply copy the desired text using the method of your choice, select the encryption 
            operation from the left click menu, follow the prompts and paste the new contents of 
            the clipboard into your application or view them in a display window after enabling
