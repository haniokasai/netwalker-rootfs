        In order to play DVDs you must install some additional software. 
        Unfortunately, DVD support cannot be provided by default in Ubuntu due

        Some video formats, such as Flash, QuickTime, and Windows Media Video,

        <para>
        You will be offered the choice of several players. The 
        <guilabel>Adobe Flash Player</guilabel> is the official plugin, which 
        should offer the best support for videos. Unfortunately, it is 
        proprietary software and so cannot be supported directly by Ubuntu. 
        The Swfdec and Gnash players are not proprietary and so are supported. 
        You may also find them to be more stable (cause fewer problems) than 
        the official player.

    <title>What is a codec?</title>
    <para>
    A <emphasis>multimedia codec</emphasis> is a small piece of software which 
    allows you to watch videos or listen to music of a specific format. There 
    are many different multimedia formats and so you may need to install 
    several codecs. Ubuntu includes many codecs by default.
    </para>
    <para>
    Many applications in Ubuntu use the <application>GStreamer</application> 
    open source multimedia framework. The codec plugins for 
    <application>GStreamer</application> are organised in different packages 
    depending on the licensing that applies to the various codecs. You can see 
    which codecs are contained in which plugin on the

        <para>
        In some countries, the use of certain codecs may be prohibited by law. 
        You should verify that you are permitted to use them before installing 
        them.
