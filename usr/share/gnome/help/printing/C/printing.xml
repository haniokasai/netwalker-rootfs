	Most printers will be automatically supported by Ubuntu. The 
	<application>Printer Configuration</application> application allows you to 
	add printers, as well as modify their settings. You can also use this 
	application to share the printer with other computers on a network, disable 
	the printer, or restart it.

    <title>Local Printing</title>
    <para>
    A local printer is one which is directly connected to your computer 
    (as opposed to a network printer, discussed in the following section).
    </para>
    <para>
    To setup a new local printer, plug your printer into your computer and 
    power it on. Most printers will automatically be detected an configured. 
    Once detected, a printer icon will appear in the notification area and 
    after waiting a few moments, you should get a popup with the text 
    <guilabel>Printer is ready for printing</guilabel>.
    </para>
    <para>
    If your printer was not detected after a few moments, then you will need to 
    follow these steps:
    </para>
	<procedure>
		<step>
		<para>
		Obtain the model name of your printer.
		</para>
		</step>
		<step>
		<para>
		Ensure the printer is turned on.
		</para>
		</step>
		<step>
		<para>
		Choose &printing;
		</para>
		</step>
		<step>
		<para>
		Click <menuchoice><guibutton>New Printer</guibutton></menuchoice>.
		</para>
		</step>
		<step>
		<para>
		Your printer should be automatically detected. If so, simply click 
		<guibutton>Forward</guibutton> and then <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>.
		</para>
		</step>
		<step>
		<para>
		Finally, you can enter in a description and location for your printer.
		</para>
		</step>
	</procedure>
    <para>
    If your printer was not automatically detected, you can try to select the 
    port and printer driver manually. Some printers need further setup. Search 
    the databases at 
    <ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/">LinuxPrinting.org</ulink> or 
    check the 
    <ulink url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters">

	<title>Scanning</title>
    <para>
    Many scanners are automatically supported by Ubuntu, and should be easy to 
    install and operate. This section will walk you through how to use your 
    scanner and what to do if Ubuntu does not detect your scanner.
    </para>
    
<section>
    <title>Does my scanner work with Ubuntu?</title>
	<para>
	There are three ways to see if you scanner works in Ubuntu:
	</para>
    <procedure>
	<step>
	<para>
	Simply plug it in and try it! If it is a newer Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
	scanner, it is likely that it will just work.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Check the 
	<ulink url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsScanners">list 
	of supported scanners</ulink> for Ubuntu.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Check the <ulink url="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html">
	SANE project listing of support scanners</ulink>. SANE is the software used 
	by Ubuntu for most of its scanner support.
	</para>
	</step>
    </procedure>
</section>
    
<section>
    <title>Using your scanner</title>
    <para>
    To scan a document:
    </para>
    <procedure>
	<step>
	<para>
	Place what you want to scan on the scanner.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Click &xsane;.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Alternately, pressing the scan button on the scanner should also work.
	</para>
	</step>
    </procedure>
</section>

<section>
    <title>What if it says "No devices available"?</title>
    <para>
    There are two reasons why you might get this message:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Your scanner is not supported in Ubuntu. For example, most parallel port 
	scanners and Lexmark All-in-One printer/scanner/faxes are not supported.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	The driver for your scanner is not being loaded automatically.
	</para>
	</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
    You may be able to get your scanner working by installing a driver or 
    altering some configuration files. Please ask for advice on the 
    <ulink url="http://ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu forums</ulink> or similar.
    </para>
    
    <note>
    <para>
    To get some scanners working, you may need to plug in the scanner 
    <emphasis>after</emphasis> the computer has booted.
    </para>
    </note>
</section>
    
<section>
    <title>Manually installing a scanner</title>
    <para>
    There are some scanners that have less than complete drivers from the SANE 
    project. They can sometimes be used, but not all the features may work.
    </para>
    <procedure>
	<step>
	<para>
	Install the <ulink url="apt:libsane-extras">libsane-extras</ulink> package.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>, type 
	<userinput>gksudo gedit /etc/sane.d/dll.conf</userinput> into the box and 
	click <guibutton>Run</guibutton> to open the SANE driver file for editing.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Enable the right driver for your scanner by removing the <quote>#</quote> 
	from in front of the name of the driver. You may need to search the web to 
	find out which driver is the right one.
	</para>
	</step>
	<step>
	<para>
	Save the file and open Xsane (&xsane;). Your scanner will hopefully work.
	</para>
