    <para>Windows network shares are also referred to as Samba or <firstterm>SMB</firstterm>
shares. When you configure a printer on an SMB share, you must enter a username
and password for the print queue. </para>
    <para>The username and password for the print queue is stored as unencrypted
text in the file <filename>/etc/cups/printers.conf</filename>.
This file has read-only permissions for users with root privileges, so any
user with root privileges can read the username and password for the print
queue. </para>
    <para>To reduce the impact of possible security violations, ensure that the
username and password required to access the print queue is used only for
the print queue.  This ensures that any possible security violation is restricted
to unauthorized use of the print queue.</para>
