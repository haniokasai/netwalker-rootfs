<title>Low Vision or Blindness</title>
<para>
From low vision to blindness, the range of visual limitations is broad. Symptoms of low vision include dimness, haziness, extreme far-/near-sightedness, color blindness, and tunnel vision, among others. People with these disabilities are concerned with being able to see text or images on a computer screen and being able to perform tasks that 
require eye-hand coordination, such as moving a computer mouse. Text size and color can make a big difference in legibility for people with low vision.

<para>
A theme is a group of coordinated settings that specifies how a desktop component or a group of desktop components appears. You can use themes to modify and control the appearance of the desktop in a consistent manner. When you apply a theme, the system modifies many desktop components simultaneously to achieve the desired effect. For example, if you apply a theme that increases the font size across the desktop, the theme also modifies the size of panels and icons on the desktop for optimum compatibility with the font size. Some themes have suggested font settings that may optionally be auto-set; in addition, most colors within a theme can be customized.
</para>
<para>
A theme contains settings that affect different parts of the desktop:

The controls setting for a theme determines the visual appearance of all windows, applications, panels, and panel applications. The controls setting also determines the visual appearance of the GNOME-compliant interface items that appear on windows, applications, panels, and panel applications such as menus, icons, and buttons. Some of the control options that are available in the desktop are designed for special accessibility needs.

<section>
<title>Introduction to Orca</title>
<section>
<title>What is Orca?</title>
<para>
Orca is a flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive technology for people with visual impairments. Using various combinations of speech synthesis, braille and magnification, Orca helps provide access to applications
and toolkits that support the AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME Desktop). <application>Orca</application> is also free open source software.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Why the name Orca?</title>
<para>
One of the first DOS screen readers was Flipper, made by Omnichron Corporation in Berkeley, CA. It was named Flipper in part because the blind wife of the programmer 
envisioned computers as being programmed by flipping switches (an accurate image of a bygone era). Then came another DOS screen reader, this one from Henter-Joyce in 
Florida - "Jobs Access With Speech" (or JAWS). And so on....
</para>
<para>
Although no obvious connection exists between blindness and creatures from the sea, there is certainly a naming tradition for screen-reader software. Hence <application>Orca</application>, which is a lot tougher-sounding than Nemo, Ariel, Willy, or Mr. Limpet.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>What's the schedule?</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> is part of the GNOME platform and <application>Orca</application>'s releases are coupled with the releases of the GNOME platform.

<section>
<title>Is braille supported?</title>
<para>
Yes! Braille is supported via BrlTTY and it is tightly integrated with Orca. BrlTTY offers support for nearly every refreshable braille display known to man.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Is contracted braille supported?</title>
<para>
Yes, <application>Orca</application> fully supports contracted braille output.
</para>

<section>
<title>What voices are available?</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> provides interfaces to both <userinput>gnome-speech</userinput> and <userinput>emacspeak</userinput> speech services. As such, the available voices for <application>Orca</application> are only restricted by the speech engines supported by the available speech services. For free speech engines, you typically have a choice of the eSpeak, Festival, and FreeTTS speech engines. For commercial engines, you have a choice of 
additional engines such as Fonix DECtalk, Loquendo, Eloquence, Cepstral and IBMTTS, with others on the way. Periodically check the <userinput>gnome-speech</userinput> package for more progress in this area.
</para>

<section>
<title>What languages are supported?</title>
<para>
The <ulink url="http://l10n.gnome.org/teams">
GNOME translation teams</ulink> are composed of many passionate volunteers from around the world. These teams do a great job and keep an up-to-date status report. See the <ulink url="http://l10n.gnome.org/module/orca">
Orca translation status page</ulink> for the large number of languages into which <application>Orca</application> has been translated.
</para>
<para> 
Note: support for a language also depends on 
the speech synthesis engine also supporting the same language.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>How well does magnification work?</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> currently uses the <userinput>gnome-mag</userinput> 
magnification service. <userinput>gnome-mag</userinput> has incorporated support for smoother full-screen magnification, which 
relies upon newer extensions in the X Window System server. These extensions do not always function well on all platforms, so smooth full-screen magnification may not always work.

<section id="enable-orca">
<title>Enabling Orca</title>
<para>
For a text-only guided setup, open a Run dialog with <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> and use the command <userinput>orca --text-setup</userinput> <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The first time <application>Orca</application> is launched you will be asked a few questions:
</para>
<para>
First you will be presented with a list of languages to choose from; there are currently about 45 languages supported. Most of this list will scroll off the screen, so you may have to use the terminal's scrollbar to view earlier parts of the list. Type in the number of your language choice (e.g., 7 for American English) and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  You do not need to wait for the entire list to be spoken, and Orca attempts to make your default language the first choice (choice 1).
</para>
<para>
You are next asked to set <guilabel>Echo By Word</guilabel>. This option instructs <application>Orca</application> to speak words as you finish typing them. Type <keycap>y</keycap> or <keycap>n</keycap> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The next item is <guilabel>Key Echo</guilabel>. This option will speak all keys as they are pressed. Type <keycap>y</keycap> or <keycap>n</keycap> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
Now select your desired keyboard layout; generally, you will want to choose the layout that matches your keyboard type - 1 for Desktop or 2 for Laptop. This choice will determine what key will act as the <application>Orca</application> modifier key. The Desktop layout uses <keycap>Insert</keycap> while the Laptop layout uses <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap>. A system, host, shift or modifier key is one which is used in conjunction with other keys, enabling keyboard access to most program functions.
</para>
<para>
Next, specify if you require braille output. This functionality assumes a BrlTTY-compatible device is available. Type <keycap>y</keycap> or <keycap>n</keycap> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Note that you can usually just enter <keycap>y</keycap> here; Orca will recover gracefully and function even if it cannot find BrlTTY.
</para>
<para>
Lastly, indicate whether you want an on-screen braille output monitor. This is mostly for developers who need to verify BrlTTY output, but may also be useful in other situations, such as visually diagnosing or verifying braille output. Type <keycap>y</keycap> or <keycap>n</keycap> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
That's it! <application>Orca</application> is now ready for use. If accessibility was not yet enabled, <application>Orca</application> does so now and asks you to logout and back in for the services to start. Type <keycap>y</keycap> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to restart your login session.
</para>
<para>
After completing the first-time <application>Orca</application> settings, use <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> to bring up the Run dialog, type in <literal>orca</literal> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. Accessibility functions should now be active.  Orca's Configuration GUI (<xref linkend="configuration-gui"/>) also has an option to let you indicate that Orca should be started automatically when you log in.
</para>
<para>
If you plan to use the Magnifier portion of <application>Orca</application> in full screen mode, nonfirm the <application>Xserver</application> "Composite" extension is enabled: use <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> to bring up the Run dialog, type in <literal>xdpyinfo</literal> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Look for the string "Composite" in the output.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Using Orca</title>
<section>
<title>Initial Setup</title>
<para>
When you run <application>Orca</application> for the first time, it will automatically enter setup mode. If you want to run setup 
at some later point, you can pass the
<userinput>--setup</userinput> option to <application>Orca</application> the next 
time you run it. Furthermore, while <application>Orca</application> is running, 
you can press <keycombo><keycap>Insert</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo> to bring up <application>Orca</application>'s Configuration GUI (<xref linkend="configuration-gui"/>). Finally, <application>Orca</application> provides a text setup utility that you can start by passing the 
<userinput>--text-setup</userinput> option to <application>Orca</application>. All of these options will create a <userinput>~/.orca/user-settings.py</userinput> file that holds your preferences and will also enable the accessibility infrastructure. You need to log out and log back in for the new settings to take effect.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>How do I run Orca?</title>
<para>
Run <application>Orca</application> by typing <userinput>orca</userinput> in a terminal session window. You can do so from a virtual 
console window if you do not yet have access to the GUI. With the GUI installed you can also press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap>
<keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo><keycap>Meta</keycap>
<keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> to bring up the Run dialog and then type <userinput>orca</userinput> as the command (followed by any optional parameters).  Then, press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. <application>Orca</application> will automatically enter text setup mode if you run it from a virtual console window or your GUI environment is not yet set up for accessibility.
</para>

The <application>Orca</application> main window provides you with a graphical way to display the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI (also accessible with <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, where Orca_Modifier is <keycap>Insert</keycap> when you use the Desktop Keyboard Layout (<xref linkend="orca-desktop-keys"/>) and <keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap> when you use the Laptop Keyboard Layout (<xref linkend="orca-laptop-keys"/>)). The main window also provides a <guibutton>Quit</guibutton> option, also available with <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo>). Many users do not like the <application>Orca</application> main window because it shows up in the window manager's tab order when you press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> to switch windows. By deselecting the "Show Orca main window" button, you can tell <application>Orca</application> to not show the <application>Orca</application> main window.

<section>
<title>Disable gksu keyboard grab</title>
<para>
When running commands from the launch menu, many distributions use an application known as <application>gksu</application> to authorize the user to run these commands; <application>gksu</application> is the GUI that asks you for your password. When it runs, <application>gksu</application> enables what is known as a "keyboard grab," which is a feature to prevent keyboard actions from going to any other application on the desktop, including <application>Orca</application>.  The result of a keyboard grab is that <application>Orca</application> will not receive any keyboard events, preventing <application>Orca</application> from functioning normally.
</para>
<para>
By selecting the "Disable gksu keyboard grab" button, you will turn off the keyboard grab behavior, allowing <application>Orca</application> to function normally with system administration applications.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The keyboard grab is a security attempt by <application>gksu</application> to prevent nefarious applications from "sniffing" the keyboard and grabbing secret information.  Please be advised that disabling the gksu keyboard grab feature can expose you to such nefarious behavior. If you do not feel comfortable with this, you can always use the root account for system administration purposes. To do so, you need to enable the root account for login, and then logout and log back in as root whenever you want to perform a system administration command.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section>
<title>Present tooltips</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell <application>Orca</application> to present information about tooltips when they appear as the result of mouse hovering. Specific actions to force tooltips to appear, such as pressing <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> when an object has focus, will always result in tooltips being presented, regardless of this setting.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak object under mouse</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell <application>Orca</application> to present information about the object under the mouse when you move it around the screen. Note that this can cause <application>Firefox</application> and <application>Thunderbird</application> versions 2.x and earlier to crash; this is not a problem with <application>Firefox</application> and <application>Thunderbird</application> versions 3.x and later.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Start Orca when you login</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell the system to automatically launch <application>Orca</application> when you log in.

<para>
The speech page allows you to customize how <application>Orca</application> uses speech synthesis.
</para>

<section>
<title>Enable speech</title>
<para>
The first control of note on the speech page is the "enable speech" check box. This check box toggles whether or not <application>Orca</application> will make use of a speech synthesizer. This option, along with the ability to enable braille and enable magnifier support, allow <application>Orca</application> to be tailored to meet the needs of a wide variety of users.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speech System and Speech Synthesizer</title>
<para>
The next two controls deal with selecting the speech system and synthesizer. <application>Orca</application> provides support for a growing number of speech systems. At the time of this writing, these include GNOME-speech, Emacspeak, and an experimental backend for Speech Dispatcher.  Depending upon how your machine is configured, you may have all or none of these options.  Typically, you will have just GNOME-speech.
</para>
<para>
First, determine which speech system you would like to use - GNOME-speech works best at this time. After making your selection, tab to the speech synthesizer combo box and choose from the list of available synthesizers.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Voice Settings</title>
<para>
If your synthesizer supports it, <application>Orca</application> can utilize multiple voices in order to identify special cases within an application, such as hyperlinks or upper case text. The voice settings and person combo boxes can be adjusted to customize these settings to your liking. For example, assume you were using Fonix DECtalk and wanted the Betty voice to denote upper case. To accomplish this, you could do the following:
</para>
<procedure>
<step>
<para>
Tab to the voice settings combo box, and down arrow until the upper case voice is selected.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Tab to the person combo box, and down arrow to choose the Betty voice.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
The next three sliders in the tab order allow adjustment of the synthesizer's rate, pitch and volume, respectively.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Punctuation Level</title>
<para>
The punctuation level radio button group is used to adjust the amount of punctuation spoken by the synthesizer. The available levels are None, Some, Most and All.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Verbosity</title>
<para>
The verbosity setting determines the amount of information that will be spoken in certain situations. For example, if it is set to verbose, the synthesizer will speak shortcut keys for items in pull down menus. When it is set to brief, these shortcut keys are not announced.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Table Row Speech</title>
<para>
The table row speech option determines the way in which <application>Orca</application> will read items within tables. The available settings are "speak current row" or "speak current cell". The ability to adjust this behavior can be useful in many situations.  For example, consider the process of browsing email messages in <application>Evolution</application>. In this instance it may be preferable to set table speech to "speak current row" so that while arrowing through the list of messages all relevant info, such as the sender, subject, and whether the message has attachments, is read automatically. While the current row setting is active, it is still possible to read individual cells by using the left and right arrows.
</para>
<note>
<para>
You can quickly toggle this behavior by pressing <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>F11</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Progress Bar Updates</title>
<para>
If this setting is enabled, <application>Orca</application> will periodically announce the status of progress bars. How often the announcement is made is determined by the value chosen in the <guilabel>Update Interval</guilabel> spin button. Note that this spin button is only available if the "Speak progress bar updates" checkbox has been checked.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Indentation and Justification</title>
<para>
When working with code or editing other documents it is often desirable to be aware of justification and indentation. Selecting the "Speak indentation and justification" check box will cause <application>Orca</application> to provide this information.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Blank Lines</title>
<para>
Some users desire to hear "blank" when navigating to a blank line in a document.  Other users do not. If the "speak blank lines" check box is selected, <application>Orca</application> will speak blank lines.
</para>
</section>

<section>

<para>
The braille page allows you to customize various aspects about the use of braille.
</para>
<note>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> does not automatically start BrlTTY for you; typically you need to do this yourself, usually at boot time.
</para>
</note>

<section>
<title>Enable Braille Support</title>
<para>
The first control on the braille page is the "Enable braille support" check box. This check box toggles whether or not <application>Orca</application> will make use of a braille display. This option, along with the ability to enable braille and enable magnifier support, allow <application>Orca</application> to be tailored to meet the needs of a wide variety of users. By default, this check box is enabled. If BrlTTY is not running, <application>Orca</application> will recover gracefully and will not communicate with the braille display. If you configure BrlTTY later on, you need to restart <application>Orca</application> in order for it to use braille.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Braille Monitor</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application>'s braille monitor provides an on-screen representation of what takes place on the braille display. This feature is mostly for demonstration purposes, but is also useful for <application>Orca</application> developers who do not have access to a braille display.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Abbreviated Role Names</title>
<para>
The "Abbreviated role names" check box determines the manner in which role names are displayed and can be used to help conserve real estate on the braille display. The "Abbreviated role names" option can be better understood if we consider the following example. Let us assume that a slider had focus, and that the abbreviated role names box was not checked. In this case, the word "slider" would be shown on the display, to reflect the fact that the current control was indeed a slider. If the abbreviated role names box were checked, the word "slider" would be abbreviated to "sldr".
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Disable end of line symbol</title>
<para>
When checked, this feature tells <application>Orca</application> to not present the "$l" string at the end of a line.

<section>
<title>Verbosity</title>
<para>
The verbosity radio button group determines the amount of information that will be brailled in certain situations. For example, if it is set to verbose, keyboard shortcut and role name information is displayed. This information is not displayed in brief mode.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Selection Indicator</title>
<para>
When you select text, <application>Orca</application> will "underline" that text on your braille display with Dots 7 and 8. If you would prefer, you can change the indicator to only be Dot 7, only be Dot 8, or not be present at all.

<para>
The key echo page allows you to specify the behavior of <application>Orca</application> when pressing keys on the page and whether words are spoken as you complete them.
</para>

<section>
<title>Enable Key Echo</title>
<para>
The first control on the key echo page is the "Enable key echo" check box. When this box is selected, six additional check boxes become available. These are: "Enable alphanumeric and punctuation keys", "Enable modifier keys", "Enable locking keys", "Enable function keys", "Enable action keys", and "Enable navigation keys".
</para>
<para>
The alphanumeric and function key groups are relatively self explanatory.
</para>
<para>
Modifier keys are those such as <keycap>Shift</keycap>, <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>, and <keycap>Alt</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
Locking keys include <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap>, <keycap>Scroll Lock</keycap> and <keycap>Num Lock</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The action keys group consists of keys that perform some logical action, such as <keycap>Backspace</keycap>, <keycap>Return</keycap> and <keycap>Tab</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The navigation keys group include the four arrow keys as well as any key combination in which the Orca Modifier key is being held down. The latter is designed to prevent <application>Orca</application> from echoing flat review commands.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Echo by Word</title>
<para>
The next toggle on the key echo page is the "Enable echo by word" check box, used to echo the word you just typed. The "Echo by word" control is always available, regardless of whether any of the key echo options are checked.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Echo by Sentence</title>
<para>
The last toggle on the key echo page is the "Enable echo by sentence" check box, used to echo the sentence you just typed. The echo by sentence control is always available, regardless of whether any of the key echo options are checked.
</para>
<para>
In summary, the key echo scheme can offer a great deal of flexibility. For example, one user might choose to enable all key echo options, while another might prefer to use word echo, but only have locking keys announced.

The first control on the key bindings page allows you to examine which key (or keys) acts as the "<application>Orca</application> modifier." The <application>Orca</application> modifier is the key that you press and hold in conjunction with other keys to give commands to <application>Orca</application>. For  desktop keyboards, the Orca modifier defaults to <keycap>Insert</keycap>. For laptop keyboards, the <application>Orca</application> modifier defaults to the <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap> key.  See the Desktop Keyboard Layout (<xref linkend="orca-desktop-keys"/>) and Laptop Keyboard Layout (<xref linkend="orca-laptop-keys"/>) sections for the default values.

<title>Key Bindings Table</title>
<para>
The key bindings table provides a list of <application>Orca</application> operations and the keys that are bound to them.
</para>
<para>
The "Function" column header is a description of the <application>Orca</application> operation to be performed.
</para>
<para>
The "Key Binding" header is the primary way to invoke the function from the keyboard. Note that the function description may include the word "Orca". This indicates that the <application>Orca</application> modifier key should be held down along with the other keys.
</para>
<para>
The "Alternate" header provides an alternate mechanism for invoking the function from the keyboard.
</para>
<para>
To modify either the "Key Binding" or the "Alternate" bindings, arrow to the cell and press <keycap>Return</keycap>. Then, press a key combination and press <keycap>Return</keycap> to confirm the new combination. When you do so, the new keystroke will be saved and the check box in the last column (the "Modified" column) will indicate that the key binding has been modified.
</para>
<para>
To undo a modified keybinding, merely arrow to the modified column, uncheck the checkbox, and press the "Apply" button <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>.

These are commands which we feel will be very useful for some users, but not needed by most users. Rather than "use up" a keystroke for such commands, we have left them unassigned.  You can assign a keystroke to any of these unbound commands by following the procedure outlined above. In addition, you can unbind any bound command in a similar fashion: press <keycap>Return</keycap> to edit the keybinding, and when prompted for the new keybinding, press <keycap>Delete</keycap> or <keycap>Backspace</keycap>. You will be told that the key binding has been removed. Press <keycap>Return</keycap> to confirm.

<application>Orca</application> will speak known text attribute information about an object when you press <keycombo><keycap>Insert</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> (desktop layout) or <keycombo><keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> (laptop layout). Because the number of text attributes is large, and not everyone cares about every attribute, the "Text Attributes" tab of the configuration
GUI allows you to customize which text attributes <application>Orca</application> will present.
</para>
<para>
On this tab is a text attribute list, where each row consists of four columns:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
The name of the text attribute.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
A checkbox which the user can set to indicate whether this text attribute should be spoken or not.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
A checkbox which the user can set to indicate whether this text attribute should be "underlined" on the braille display.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
An editable "Present unless" string value. By default, not all text attributes will have this set. If present, what it means (assuming the user wants this text attribute presented) is that the value of the attribute will only be presented if it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> this value.
</para>
<para>
For example, by default the "underline" text attribute has a value of "none." If the user has this attribute checked and the user types
<keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> and the text in question is not underlined, then this
attribute is not spoken. If you always want this attribute to be spoken irrespective of whether the text is underlined, then the
attribute should be checked and the "Present unless" value cleared.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
There is also a <guibutton>Reset</guibutton> button (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo>) which will set the list values back to their initial state when the dialog was first displayed.
</para>
</listitem>

</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move to top</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>T</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute to the top of the list.

<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move down one</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute down one row.

</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
Beneath these push buttons is the Braille Indicator group of radio buttons. Here you can select the cell or cells to be used to indicate text which has at least one of the specified attributes. Your choices are:
</para>

You can get a complete list of available keyboard commands by visiting the <guilabel>Key Bindings</guilabel> page of the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI (<xref linkend="orca-keybindings-page"/>). To bring up the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI, press <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, where <userinput>Orca_Modifier</userinput> is the <keycap>Insert</keycap> key for the <link linkend="orca-desktop-keys">desktop layout</link> and the <keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap> key for the <link linkend="orca-laptop-keys">laptop layout</link>. Note that you can also enter <application>Orca</application>'s "learn mode" while running <application>Orca</application> by pressing <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>H</keycap></keycombo>. When in learn mode, <application>Orca</application> will intercept all keyboard and braille input events and tell you what the effect would be.  To exit learn mode, press the <keycap>Escape</keycap> key.
</para>
<note>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> provides additional commands for some applications, such as <application>Firefox</application>.  To get the list of additional commands for an application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo> when that application has focus. This will bring up the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI in the "application-specific" state, and the additional commands will appear in the <guilabel>Key Bindings</guilabel> page.

The GNOME Desktop itself also has <ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/stable/shortcuts-global.html.en">built in keyboard commands</ulink> to control the desktop and its applications.

WARNING: the MouseKeys functionality of AccessX can interfere with the <application>Orca</application> modifier key (see <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548169">bug 548169</ulink>), resulting in odd behavior. In particular, MouseKeys uses the <keycap>KP_Insert</keycap> key to emulate a mouse button press. When enabled, MouseKeys can conflict with <keycap>KP_Insert</keycap> as the <application>Orca</application> modifier, resulting in what appears to be a stuck <application>Orca</application> modifier key.  As an alternative, you can use the <link linkend="orca-laptop-keys">laptop key bindings</link>, which avoids the keypad for <application>Orca</application> commands. If you accidentally enabled MouseKeys, you can disable it via the <application>gnome-keyboard-properties</application> application.

The above commands apply when working with objects as well as when working with text.  For example, if the flat review cursor were positioned on a menu bar, pressing the "read current line" command would speak the names of all visible menus. Similarly, pressing the "read next word" command would speak the object to the right of the flat review cursor on the same line, or move flat review to the next line if no more objects were found.

<title>Accessible Applications</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> is designed to work with applications and toolkits that support the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI). This includes the GNOME Desktop and its bundled applications: OpenOffice, Firefox, and the Java platform. Some applications work better than others, however, and the <application>Orca</application> community continually works to provide superior access to more and more applications.

<title>Using Adobe's Acrobat Reader</title>
<para>
We are currently working on a script for Adobe's Acrobat Reader, and the initial version has been contributed to <application>Orca</application> v2.17.5. Note that there is still work to do, and we are very encouraged by Adobe's commitment to accessibility.
</para>

<section>
<title>Installation</title>
<para>
If you get Adobe Acrobat Reader directly from the <ulink url='http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html'>Adobe site</ulink>, you may find that the software will not launch. If launched from the Applications menu, it may appear that nothing has happened, or if launched from a terminal window you may receive a long series of syntax error messages. Should this occur, you will need to edit your /usr/bin/acroread file as described in this <ulink url='http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=233514'>Ubuntu forum thread</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
If you instead choose to install Acrobat Reader from your distribution's packages, be sure to install both <application>acroread</application> and <application>acroread-plugins</application>. Without the plugins package, you will not have the access to the "Reading" category in the <menuchoice>
<guimenuitem>Edit-</guimenuitem>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> dialog.
</para>
<para>
Note: If you use Ubuntu and cannot locate the
<application>acroread</application> package, you will likely need to edit your /etc/apt/sources.list to include the 'multiverse' repository. Then run <userinput>apt-get update</userinput>. Having done so, you should then be able to install both <application>acroread</application> and <application>acroread-plugins</application>.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enabling Accessibility and Caret Navigation</title>

Once you've installed Reader, you need to enable accessibility:

<para>
In the "Accessibility" tab of the 
<menuchoice>
<guimenuitem>Edit-</guimenuitem>

<guilabel>Always display the keyboard selection cursor</guilabel> (<keycombo>
<keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>D</keycap>

<keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>) is checked.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</section>

<section>
<title>Working with Untagged Documents</title>
<para>
When you open an untagged document, you will be presented with a dialog box asking you to specify the reading order and the reading mode options. The default reading order is 
<guilabel>Infer reading order from document
</guilabel>. This setting works well for most documents.
</para>
<para>
The default reading mode will vary depending on the length of the document; for short documents, the default is <guilabel>Read the entire document</guilabel>; for long documents the default is <guilabel>Read currently visible pages only</guilabel>. <application>Orca</application> tends to work better when <guilabel>Read the entire document</guilabel> is selected.
</para>
<para>
If you find that a document seems to be missing parts of the text, try changing the reading options. To do so, get into the Document menu and select <guilabel>Change Accessibility Reading Options...</guilabel> or use the shortcut <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>5</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Page Layout</title>
<para>
The best page layout for reading a document with <application>Orca</application> is <guilabel>Single Page</guilabel>. When <guilabel>Continuous</guilabel> is chosen, moving focus to text as the page is scrolling 
can cause that text not to be read. You can change the page layout to <guilabel>Single Page</guilabel> by getting into the View menu and selecting the Page Layout submenu.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Navigating Tables</title>
<para>
As far as we know there isn't currently a whole lot of keyboard support for tables in
<application>Acrobat Reader</application>. We hope Adobe will remedy this soon.
</para>
<para>
Basically, there are the arrow keys. Their behavior is to move you first within the cell with focus, then to the next cell with data in it. Note that currently, Up and Down Arrow do not seem to move you vertically among cells - at least that has been the experience 
with the tables we have tried. Instead, Up and Down seem to move you horizontally until you run out of cells on the current row.
</para>

<section>
<title>Making Application-Specific Settings</title>
<para>
To customize the settings for a particular application, you will first need to run that application. Make sure the application has focus, then press <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap>
<keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap>
</keycombo> (by default, this will be 
<keycombo><keycap>Insert</keycap><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
<keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo> for the Desktop keyboard layout).
</para>
<para>
This brings up a tabbed dialog window very similar to the <application>Orca</application> configuration dialog, but with the following differences:
</para>
<orderedlist numeration='arabic'>
<listitem>
<para>
There is no initial General pane.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
The Speech System and Speech Synthesizer combo
boxes on the Speech pane will be grayed out (made inactive).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Any existing application-specific key bindings will appear at the top of the list on the Key Bindings pane.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
There may be a new application-specific settings pane at the end of the set of tabbed panes. Note that pressing the End key from the tab list will get you directly to the right-most tab.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
Adjust your application-specific settings in the same way you set your general <application>Orca</application> preferences.
For example, you may have Key Echo disabled generally in <application>Orca</application> but would like to specifically have it enabled for the <application>gcalctool</application> (GNOME Calculator) application. Here's where you could easily set that.
</para>
<para>
When you have your application settings customized the way you want, press the <guilabel>OK</guilabel> button. These settings will be written to your 
<userinput>~/.orca/app-settings</userinput> directory in a file called 
<userinput>&lt;APPNAME&gt;.py</userinput>, where <userinput>&lt;APPNAME&gt;</userinput> is the name of the application.
</para>
<para>
These files are automatically written by <application>Orca</application>. The contents of the file will be overwritten each time you change your application settings for that
application.
</para>
<para>
If you want to have some extra application-specific settings or code that you don't want to lose, then you should put it in a file called <userinput>~/.orca/app-settings/&lt;APPNAME&gt;-customizations.py</userinput>. This file will be automatically read when the settings for the 
<userinput>&lt;APPNAME&gt;</userinput> application are loaded.
</para>
<para>
Note that this is an advanced feature that we don't expect many people to use. It's just there if you really want it.
</para>
<para>
There is currently one known bug (some people would call it a feature) that we are trying to track down and fix:
</para>
<note>
<para>
If you adjust one or more application-specific key bindings, the new values will not take effect until you've pressed the <guilabel>OK</guilabel> button. The work-around is to either restart <application>Orca</application>, or Alt-Tab 
away to some other application and then Alt-Tab back to the one that you've just changed the key bindings for.

<application>Orca</application> uses 
<ulink url='http://mielke.cc/brltty/'>BrlTTY</ulink> for braille support. On Linux systems, BrlTTY is used to access the text mode console content. On a typical braille-enabled installation of Linux, BrlTTY is already running and providing access to the text consoles. When Orca starts, it connects to BrlTTY. If you switch from a text console to your X Windows session, your braille display will automatically follow and display the content that Orca is presenting to you.

<para>
<application>Orca</application> attempts to work with various releases of BrlTTY. It works well with BrlTTY v3.7.2, and we've also been working with the BrlTTY team to get it going for BrlTTY v3.8. The remainder of this document provides information related to using <application>Orca</application> with <application>BrlTTY</application> 3.8.

Below are descriptions of the necessary tasks to install/setup BrlTTY in Ubuntu and Solaris. For both, you need to first obtain

brltty-3.8.tar.gz'>brltty-3.8.tar.gz</ulink> from the BrlTTY site.

<title>BrlTTY 3.8 on Ubuntu</title>
<para>
First, configure your build environment to build BrlTTY. Much of this setup is done for you automatically in the Ubuntu distribution with products such as G++ already present. In addition, <emphasis>you must</emphasis> 
also install tcl, Pyrex, and the Python developer environment. To do this, execute the following commands as <userinput>root</userinput>:

Then, when you build BrlTTY, avoid configuring the package with --prefix=/usr. Use the standard procedure instead, executing the following commands as <userinput>root</userinput>:

If you want, you can remove the existing 
<userinput>/sbin/brltty</userinput> and replace it with the <userinput>/bin/brltty</userinput>, either by copying the <userinput>/bin/brltty</userinput> to <userinput>/sbin/brltty</userinput> or just by making a 
symbolic link. Do so at your own risk.

<title>My desktop has stopped responding. What do I do?
</title>
<para>
Press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> to open the Run dialog and restart <application>Orca</application> by running a new instance: type <userinput>orca</userinput> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. This will force any existing <application>Orca</application> processes to exit and will then restart <application>Orca</application>. This 
sometimes has the effect of unhanging the desktop (which is usually due to an ill-behaved application).
</para>
<para>
If you cannot get to a terminal window, try 
pressing <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
<keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Backspace</keycap>
</keycombo>: shut down the X Window System server. This should return you to the login screen.
