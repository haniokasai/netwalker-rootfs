    <title>Reporting Bugs</title>
    <!-- NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This section is material taken from gnome-desktop/desktop-docs/gnome-feedback/ Look for existing translations there before translating it all over again :) -->
      <para>If you have found a bug in one of GNOME applications, please report it! Developers do read all the bug reports and try to fix these bugs. Please try to be as specific as possible when describing the circumstances under which the bug shows (what commands did you enter? which buttons did you click?). If there were any error messages, be sure to include them, too.</para> 
      <para>The easiest way to report bugs is by using <application>Bug Buddy</application>, GNOME's built-in bug reporting tool. This will launch automatically in the event that an application crashes. The details GNOME developers need are automatically collected, but you can further help by giving information about what you were doing when the crash took place.</para>
      <para>You can also submit bugs and browse the list of known bugs by connecting to the <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME bug tracking database</ulink>. You will need to register before you can submit any bugs this way — and do not forget to read <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/bugwritinghelp.html">Bug Writing Guidelines</ulink>.</para>
      
      <para>Please note that some of GNOME applications are developed outside of GNOME, or by commercial companies (these products are still free software). For example, <application>Inkscape</application>, a vector graphics application, is developed at <ulink type="http" url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/inkscape/">SourceForge</ulink>. Bugs reports and comments about these products should be directed to the respective organization or company. If you are using <application>Bug Report Tool</application>, it will automatically send bug reports to the correct database.</para>

      <!-- NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This section is material taken from gnome-desktop/desktop-docs/gnome-feedback/ Look for existing translations there before translating it all over again :) -->      
      <para>If you have a suggestion or want to request a new feature for one of the applications, it can also be done using the bug tracking database. Submit your suggestion as a bug report as described in <xref linkend="feedback-bugs"/> and at the appropriate step select <guilabel>Severity: Enhancement</guilabel>.</para>

      <title>Documentation Comments</title>
      <!-- NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This section is material taken from gnome-desktop/desktop-docs/gnome-feedback/ Look for existing translations there before translating it all over again :) -->      

      <para>If you found an inaccuracy or misprint in one of GNOME documents, or have any comments or suggestions about documentation, please let us know! The easiest way of doing so is by submitting a bug report as explained before and selecting <guilabel>Component: docs</guilabel> at appropriate steps (or <guilabel>general</guilabel> if there is no <guilabel>docs</guilabel> component). If your comment is about general GNOME documentation (such as <citetitle>GNOME Users Guide</citetitle>) rather than specific application manual, select <guilabel>Product: gnome-user-docs</guilabel>.</para>
      <para>Alternatively, you can just send your comments by email to the <ulink type="http" url="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject">GNOME Documentation Project</ulink> mailing list; our address is <email>gnome-doc-list@gnome.org</email>. And by the way: if you are not a developer but want to help GNOME — <ulink type="http" url="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Join">join the GDP</ulink> and help us improve GNOME documentation.</para>
