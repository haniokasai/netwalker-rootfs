This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Compress::Zlib
(renamed to be libcompress-zlib-perl), the Perl module for creation
and manipulation of gzip files.

Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org> assembled this package.  The
library is available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near
you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files and the modification of the examples to reference /usr/bin/perl.
