gfloppy
-------

 Gfloppy is a utility to make formatting ext2 and DOS floppies easier
using a nice GUI. It currently works only with Linux and requires the
mtools package to be installed in order for DOS floppy creation.
Additionally, you need e2fsprogs and e2fsprogs-devel installed in order
to build it.
