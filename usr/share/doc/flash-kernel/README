flash-kernel
------------

flash-kernel is a script which will put the kernel and initramfs in
the boot location of embedded devices that don't load the kernel and
initramfs directly from /boot.  flash-kernel supports devices that
boot from flash memory (hence the name) as well as some devices that
require a special boot image on the disk.

You will generally want to use this script as a post installation
hook of the kernel image.  This way, the newly installed kernel and
newly created initramfs will automatically be used after you restart
your machine (either by writing it to flash memory or by constructing
a specific boot image on disk).  In order for this to work, you have
to edit the file /etc/kernel-img.conf and add the following line:

  postinst_hook = flash-kernel
