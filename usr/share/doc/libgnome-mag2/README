Standalone Command-line interface
=================================

gnome-mag provides a command-line interface for standalone use,
although its primary goal is to provide a set of magnification
services for use by other client applications and assistive 
technologies.

For information on the "magnifier" command-line utility, type

"magnifier --help" or "magnifier --usage" after installing
gnome-mag.


Dependencies
============

In order to get SVN gnome-mag installed on your system, you need to have
the most recent SVN versions of libbonobo installed as well.
Note that gnome-mag also requires gtk+ and gnome-common.

Colorblind support requires libcolorblind from
http://alioth.debian.org/frs/download.php/1952/colorblind-0.0.1.tar.gz


Building
========

To compile a SVN version of libgail-gnome on your system, you will 
need to take several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You 
can do all these steps at once by running:

        trunk/gnome-mag# ./autogen.sh

Basically this does the following for you:

        trunk/gnome-mag# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/gnome-mag to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.
