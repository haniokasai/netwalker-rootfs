This is the debian package for the Cairo module.
It was created by Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt <he@debian.org>.

The sources were downloaded from CPAN. Many mirrors exist, but
http://search.cpan.org/~tsch/Cairo/ should be working.

The upstream authors are Ross McFarland <rwmcfa1@neces.com>
                         Torsten Schoenfeld <kaffeetisch@gmx.de>
