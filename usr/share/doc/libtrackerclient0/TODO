Ideas:
======

General:
* Extended XESAM support
* Automatic language detection

Application Support:
* Balsa mboxes
* Brasero integration
* Epiphany integration (bookmarks and history)
* Rhythmbox integration
* Tomboy notes indexing
* Modest, a mobile email client (much work already exists in svn trunk)

Search:
* Search filtering (e.g. search within specific folders)
* Search results that update in real time
* Search within archives

Internal:
* Crawler to move to Indexer
* FTS support (replacement of QDBM, the current index db)
  * Enables "exact phrase" searches
  * Enables wildcard searches
  * Enables prefix searches (pre*)
* Denormalised tables
* Better libtracker support for Maemo platform applications?
* Plugins
  * For Evolution
  * For KMail
  * For Thunderbird


2007 Tracker SoC project ideas:
===============================

1. HAL integration into Tracker, for handling removable media (done)

2. Linux kernel watchless file notification system for Tracker

    * Currently we are using inotify which is not optimal for watching entire
      trees. (OSX has kernel file notifications by contrast)
    * Implement a loadable module for the kernel which allows all file activity
      to be passed to userspace Tracker
    * Ideally should make use of netlink

3. Extend the GTK Tracker Widget Library

    * Include a generic search result widget
          o A reusable widget which can show results from tracker
          o widget should allow paging of results via scrolling instead of
            buttons (downloading of all search results in one go is not allowed
            so it needs to be smart)
          o Widget should be able to seamlessly switch into multiple views
            (icon, list, compact list)
          o Add special view when all results are exclusively Music based.
            View should show a sorted list of music metadata album, artist etc
            (similar to rhythmbox music view)
          o widget should offer basic file management including drag and drop,
            deletes, renames via popup menu
          o widget should allow watermarking of background (use cairo) with a
            definable pixmap
          o widget should allow an optional popup preview when moused over for
            a few seconds (kind of like knoqueror does) 
    * RDF Query widget
          o mockup: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=80132&action=view
          o The Rhythmbox automatic playlist may also serve useful as inspiration 

4. Better KDE Integration

    * Improve basic GUI with corresponding features from the GNOME GUI
     (tags, metadata tile, thumbnails)
    * add ability to index KContacts and KNotes 

5. Add XMP Sidecar and IPTC support to tracker

    * implement an XMP compatible parser (using glib xml parser)
    * backup all user defined metadata into XMP sidecar format
    * allow indexing of sidecar files when indexing a file so users can edit
      these files to add metadata
    * extract IPTC metadata embedded into images
    * see GNOME bug #401664

6. Networked Tracker

    * Use avahi/dbus to locate remote tracker servers. Could make use of ssh
      or as suggested use gabriel.
    * Api would need to be added to add support for retrieving list of servers
    * TST would need to be changed to list all available servers to use and
      allow user to pick one
    * If using DBus over ssh then could use seahorse for ssh key pairing
