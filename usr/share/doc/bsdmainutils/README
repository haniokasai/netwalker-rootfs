This is bsdmainutils, a collection of userland programs from the *BSD source
distributions. All of the program except for calendar(1) come from FreeBSD,
and calendar(1) comes from OpenBSD.

These sources were originally pacakged by Austin Donnelly
<and1000@debian.org>, and were based heavily on bsdutils, which was
originally put together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

After that, the package was maintained by Charles Briscoe-Smith
<cpbs@debian.org>. He gathered data for the 1999-2001 calendar files from
various sources on the Internet. Oliver Elphick, Julian Gilbey, Daniel
Martin and Jaldhar H. Vyas provided much useful data on the various religous
calendars.

After Charles, Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> maintained the package for almost
two years, before Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org> took over. The package
is now maintained by Graham Wilson <bob@decoy.wox.org>.

He replaced the FreeBSD calendar(1) with the calendar from OpenBSD(1),
thanks to a suggestion from Matt Zimmerman. Nicolas Ã‰vrard provided calendar
files for the EU and Belgium, and Martin Schulze provided a calendar with
Debian dates.

See usr.bin/calendar/source.data for more information on calendar sources.
