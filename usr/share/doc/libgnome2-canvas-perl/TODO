these are brand-new, very quickly made bindings, so there are still 
some bugs.  the ones i know about are:

- zooming the canvases in canvas_demo by holding the arrows in the
  spinbuttons sometimes results in a segfault.  not at all sure why.

- the non-english text in canvas_demo/canvas-rich-text.pl is apparently
  very much not right.

undone:

- test suite!!!
- the path def and bpath stuff needs serious testing
- there is no typemap for ArtBpath, so several things are missing from 
  GnomeCanvasPathDef.xs
- ditto for ArtSVP and GnomeCanvasUtil.xs
