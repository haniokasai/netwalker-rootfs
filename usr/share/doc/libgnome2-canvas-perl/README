Gnome2::Canvas version 1.002
============================

The Gnome2::Canvas module allows a perl developer to use the GnomeCanvas
widget with Gtk2-Perl.  Find out more about Gnome+ at http://www.gnome.org.

Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gnome2::Canvas follows the C API
of libgnomecanvas-2.0 as closely as possible while still being perlish.
Thus, the C API reference remains the canonical documentation.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    # assuming a bourne-style shell
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
    export PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
