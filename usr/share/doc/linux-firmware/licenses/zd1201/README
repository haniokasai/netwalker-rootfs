README for zd1201 Wireless USB firmware.

This package contains the firmware needed for the zd1201 devices to work.
Simply typing 'make' as root (or using 'su') should install the two firmware
files in the proper firmware directory used by the hotplug scripts.

This package contains two files, zd1201.fw is the firmware file for using the
device as a normal 802.11b client. The file zd1201-ap.fw is used to put the
device in access point mode.

Please send questions to the sourceforge forum (in case of problems add 'dmesg'
output) at http://linux-lc100020.sourceforge.net/
