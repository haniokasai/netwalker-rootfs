Read the system's "/proc/cpuinfo" special file and return the information in
the form of a STRUCT with the members based on the lines returned from the
"file". All values are either INT or STRING, based on the disposition of the
data itself. The exception to this is the key "flags", which is an ARRAY of
STRING.
