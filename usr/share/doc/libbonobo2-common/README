libbonobo is the non-GUI part of the bonobo component infrastructure,
it is most useful for creating aggregate interfaces & doing IPC
easily. It also contains a rather badly designed & implemented
per-system activation system. This needs re-writing & simplifying to
be per-display.

Take a look at samples/echo/.

This is the distribution of Bonobo, the GNOME component and compound
document system for the GNU system.

* What is Bonobo

   Bonobo is a set of language and system independant CORBA interfaces
   for creating reusable components, controls and creating compound
   documents.

   The Bonobo distribution includes a Gtk+ based implementation of the
   Bonobo interfaces, enabling developers to create reusable
   components and applications that can be used to form more complex
   documents.

   If you want to look into a Java implementation of Bonobo, look in
   the GNOME CVS for the `monkeybeans' module (Erdi Gergo is the
   author), you can browse it at: http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai

* Licensing

   Bonobo libraries are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser

* Bug reports

   File any bug reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

* What you will need

   You will need a working GNOME 2.x system with the development tools
   to compile and install Bonobo.

* Mailing lists

   gnome-components-list@gnome.org

   To subscribe, send mail to gnome-components-list-request@gnome.org

* The layout 

   You will find documentation for Bonobo in the "doc" directory.  The
   actual implementation of bonobo is in the "bonobo" directory.  The
   CORBA interfaces are in the "idl" directory.  Sample implementations
   of components and containers are in the "samples" directory.  You
   should use these implementations as your reference when you write
   Bonobo code.

   The real Bonobos are endangered species.  If you want to help
