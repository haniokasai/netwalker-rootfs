SQLITE3 DATABASE DRIVER FOR BOGOFILTER
======================================

$Id: README.sqlite 6703 2008-02-08 12:54:52Z m-a $

This document only applies if you want to use bogofilter with SQLite3
databases.

1. Overview -----------------------------------------------------------

Bogofilter 0.93.3 and newer can use recent SQLite3 versions to store
their tokens; see section 2.1 below for supported versions.

SQLite is a database that handles a large SQL subset and stores all
tables in one permanent file, and the journal for changes in one
temporary file that gets automatically removed when no longer needed.
SQLite3 ships with a command-line client for the shell, named sqlite3.

2. Prerequisites ------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Compatibility - supported SQLite versions

At this time, only SQLite 3.5.4 and newer are supported. Older versions
back to 3.0.8 may work, but you are advised to carefully review the
sqlite3 ChangeLog, because there have been several important bug fixes
since 3.0.8, including fixes for bugs that can corrupt the database.

Bogofilter prints a warning (but continues to run) when used with SQLite
versions older than 3.5.4. This warning can be suppressed by defining
the environment variable BF_USE_OLD_SQLITE to any value, including the
empty value.

2.2 Installation

To use bogofilter with the SQLite3 back-end driver, you must install a
sufficiently recent SQLite3 version before configuring bogofilter. You
can download SQLite 3 and find installation instructions for SQLite 3 at
<http://sqlite.org/>, the SQLite installation is pretty straightforward.

After that, you can configure bogofilter, add --with-database=sqlite
to the ./configure command.

3. Use ----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Care and feeding

SQLite is pretty self-maintaining.  After larger maintenance operations
to remove older tokens you may want to run this command:

    sqlite3 ~/.bogofilter/wordlist.db 'VACUUM;'

to remove unused pages from the database file and reduce the file size.

A. Miscellaneous ------------------------------------------------------

A.1 Why does bogofilter use BLOB for both columns?

bogofilter has traditionally managed its own data structure inside key
and value, BLOB allows the verbatim retrieval of such data without
stumbling across embedded NUL characters.
