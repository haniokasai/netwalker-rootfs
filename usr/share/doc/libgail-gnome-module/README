Dependencies
============

In order to get CVS libgail-gnome installed on your system, you need to have
libbonoboui and gnome-panel installed as well.
Note that libgail-gnome also requires atk and gnome-common.

Building
========

To compile a CVS version of libgail-gnome on your system, you will 
need to take several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You 
can do all these steps at once by running:

        cvsroot/libgail-gnome# ./autogen.sh

Basically this does the following for you:

        cvsroot/libgail-gnome# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/libgail-gnome to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.
