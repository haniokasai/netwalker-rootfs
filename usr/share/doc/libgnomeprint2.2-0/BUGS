1) Drivers
    1.1) Move drivers to libgnomeprint/drivers/[pdf,ps,fax]
    1.2) Make them modular (like transports).
    1.3) Supply --with-drivers=(...) option in configure.in
    1.4) Clean up interfaces: Don't access the configuration 
         directly. Implement everything using object 
         properties.
    1.5) Convert gnome-print-meta to a proper driver.

2) Transports
    2.1) Move all transports into the libgnomeprint/transports 
	  subdirectory:
	  - common (gnome-print-transport-[fd,pipe].[c,h])
		- cups (derived from gnome-print-transport-fd)
		- file (derived from gnome-print-transport-fd)
		- custom (derived from gnome-print-transport-pipe)
		- lpr (derived from gnome-print-transport-pipe)
    2.2) Supply --with-transports=(...) option in configure.in
    2.3) Make transports read/write. That way, the PostScript
	 and Meta driver would no longer need to implement the 
	 logic of creating temporary files - this would all be 
	 in gnome-print-transport (or in the transport itself 
	 if the transport does support it).
    2.4) Split gnome-print-meta into a driver and a transport.

3) Filters
    3.1) Add the possibility to apply user-defined filters to 
         the meta data (like printing all pages onto one 
         index page, selecting only odd pages, printing 'draft'
         on every page...).
    3.2) Add a tab "Filter" to the gnome-print-dialog where 
	 users can apply stock filters or design their own ones.

4) Print Preview
    4.1) Augment the mouse pointer with a representation of the 
	 objects being dragged. (HIG)
