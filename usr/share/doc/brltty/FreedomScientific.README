This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for the Focus and PacMate braille
displays from Freedom Scientific [http://www.freedomscientific.com]. It has
been implemented, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

The serial and USB ports are both supported. The following models are 
recognized:
*  Focus: 44, 70, 84
*  Focus 2: 40, 80
*  PAC Mate: 20, 40, 80

If an unrecognized model is connected then the driver makes an attempt to
determine its size and to provide generic capabilities.

The upper row of routing buttons on the PAC Mate are a set of hot keys. They
provide quick access to various braille display functions and options (see the
help file for what they actually do). There are three markers at the back of
the display's top surface, i.e. just behind the routing buttons, which help you
locate and distinguish each hot key. The keys immediately below the left and
right markers are the left and right GDF keys. Between them are eight keys ...
four on each side of the center marker. The buttons between the left GDF key
and the center marker are named (from left to right) HK1, HK2, HK3, and HK4;
those between the center marker and the right GDF key are named (from left to
right) HK5, HK6, HK7, and HK8. Any button to the left of the left GDF key acts
as the left advance key, and any button to the right of the right GDF key acts
as the right advance key. The following drawing depicts this layout visually:

                ++                     ++                     ++

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

   Parameter     Settings
   debugpackets  no, yes
   statuscells   0 (none), positive (left), negative (right)

The "statuscells" parameter specifies how many of the braille cells are to be
reserved for status indicators. Specify 0 (zero) if you'd like all the cells to
be used for text, a positive number if you'd like the status cells to be on the
left, and a negative number if you'd like them to be on the right. The default
is that the Focus displays have 3 status cells on the left, and that the PAC
Mate displays have no status cells. An additional blank cell is reserved to
separate the text and status cells from one another. Use the "Status Style"
selector of the Preferences Menu to choose the format of the data presented via
the status cells.
