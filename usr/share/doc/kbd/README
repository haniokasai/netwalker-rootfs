This is kbd-1.14.tar.gz

This package contains keytable files and keyboard utilities compatible
with kernel version 1.1.54 and later. Setfont requires 1.1.92 or later.
Major changes in keyboard and console handling occurred in 1.3.1.
The current version of kbd might not work anymore on kernels older than that.

This distribution contains no binaries - the sources depend on the
kernel version - compile them yourself.

To install this package, unpack it somewhere and issue the commands
"./configure", "make" and "make install".  This copies the utilities
to /usr/bin, man pages to /usr/man/man{1,4,5,8} and data files to the
subdirectories keymaps, unimaps, consolefonts, consoletrans and videomodes
of the datadirectory chosen during configure, probably /usr/share/kbd.

The home site of this package is
	ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/

since 1.13wip home site is

	ftp://ftp.altlinux.org/pub/people/legion/kbd/
