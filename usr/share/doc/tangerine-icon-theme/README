Tangerine Icon Theme
--------------------

This is an icon theme worked on by the Ubuntu Art Team. It currently depends 
on Imagemagick for creation of 24x24 bitmaps by adding a 1px padding around 
the 22x22px version. For GNOME and KDE you will also need icon-naming-utils 
that allow the theme to work in these environments before they follow the new 
naming scheme [2].
