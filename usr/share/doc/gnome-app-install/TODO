FEISTY:
-------
* support dependency to multi components+channels


DAPPER + 1:
-----------
* show if the application is "free", "unsupported", "commercial"
  [done]
* make it easy to show *only* applications of a given category
  [done]
* make it possible to have "Proprietary+License+section(=multiverse)",
  currently we can only show licenses if the thing is in a 3rd party
  channel (ie not in "multiverse")

FIXLIST:
-------
- DialogProprietary can't be cancelt while it downloads the license from the
  net
- some icons are not rendered by gtkhtml2 [done]
- some apps that are not available for the given hardware plattform
  (e.g. realplay on amd64) show "enable multiverse" buttons even when 
  multiverse is enabled [done]
- restore the stored state at startup time (?)

dependency handling:
--------------------

* how to prevent meta packages from locking a lot of packages. e.g.
  "ubuntu-desktop"?
* how to solve package conflicts?

user interface:
--------------

* store the state of the treeviews and the search 
* replace the html rendering for the description with a gtktextview
  [done]


non-root-mode:
--------------
* problem: some operations require two root subprocess calls, e.g.
           enable a channel requires to copy and then reload

cleanups:
---------
- redo the mime-search [done]

3rd party packages:
-------------------
- keys: how to update the channel keys when they are e.g. expired?

misc:
-----

- get rid of that terrible stores and move the bits into a "application"
  class so that the store only contains "name" and "application-class"
  [done]
- abstract the apt bits out to make it easy to port to smart
- aptsources.py should go into python-apt (currently in update-manager),
  that makes us get rid of the update-manager dependency
