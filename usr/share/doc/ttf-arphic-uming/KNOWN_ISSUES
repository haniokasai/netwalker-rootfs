  * Only two glyphs available with different shapes for different flavors.
    Please do not report bugs against this feature! This is work in progress
    and takes a lot of time!
  * Font format changed to TrueType Collection. As a result TeX users will 
    encounter trouble using this font.
  * The following programs/libraries are known to not fully support TTC files
    and can usually only use the first fontface of the TTC:
    - sun-java-6 and openjdk-6
    - imlib2 and applications which use imlib2.
