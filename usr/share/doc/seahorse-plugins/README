seahorse-plugins: plugins and utilities for encryption in GNOME
This describes version 2.26.1

Seahorse is a graphical interface for managing and using encryption keys. 
Currently it supports PGP keys (using GPG/GPGME) and SSH keys. Its goal is to 
provide an easy to use Key Management Tool, along with an easy to use interface 
for encryption operations.

Seahorse is integrated into the GNOME Desktop Environment and allows users to 
perform operations from their regular applications, like nautilus or gedit.

For more detailed information about features and their uses, see the included 
help manual or the homepage.

After installing, please give us feedback by subscribing to the seahorse-user
mailing list, posting a message to the forums on sourceforge, or submitting 
feature requests or bugs to bugzilla.gnome.org.

See below for instructions on how to install Seahorse Plugins.
