http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo

Dependencies
------------
    cairo   >= 1.4.12
    Python  >= 2.4

See the INSTALL document for build instructions.

Documentation
-------------
Currently there is no Python specific cairo API documentation. However there
is the cairo C documentation which can be useful. There is also a NOTES file
in the tarball release which lists how Pycairo differs from the cairo C API,
and there are Pycairo examples in the examples/ directory of the tarball
release.
