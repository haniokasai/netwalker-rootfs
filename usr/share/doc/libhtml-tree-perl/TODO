		      TO-DO LIST FOR HTML::Tree

* Make more and better tests!  Regression and otherwise.

* Make a smarter as_text-like method -- i.e., a sort of dimwitted
version of HTML::FormatText

* Make as_HTML emit the DOCTYPE declaration before <html...>

* Make as_XHTML that is basically as_XML with ignoreable whitespace?

* Make TreeBuilder try to repair trees with <table><input...><tr>...</table>
or <table><form...><tr>...</table> elements.  Very tricky.


* Make as_* understand ~text items

* Make extract_links do the right thing with forms with no action
  param ?

* Add 'are_element_identical' method ?

* Add 'are_content_identical' method ?

* Maybe reorganize the HTMLE::Element docs some time?
