:mod:`apt` --- Highlevel apt package
=====================================
The highlevel apt package provides a lot of functionality, all
with an easy-to-use interface.

.. warning::
    The API of this package is not considered stable. Evenmore, it is considered
    to change the naming conventions in future to lowercase_with_underscores.

    In case this happens, the API will still be kept compatible, with the old
    functions provided as deprecated ones.
