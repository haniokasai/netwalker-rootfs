.. note::

    This documentation can not be considered complete at the moment. But it
    provides better documentation than the documentation available through
    pydoc.

.. note::


    This documentation has been created by Sphinx, using reStructuredText files
    written by Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>, and in case of the apt
    package, from the documentation shipped in the modules.
