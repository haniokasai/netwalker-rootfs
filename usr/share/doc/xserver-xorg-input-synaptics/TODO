* autoload evdev kernel module if necessary?
* Use ftok to get shared memory ID.
* Add an option to disable "double-tap-and-drag" to make it possible
  to get faster double clicks.
* Better coasting speed estimation. The current algorithm uses a time
  average but over a very short time period, so it's quite easy to
  accidentally start coasting.
