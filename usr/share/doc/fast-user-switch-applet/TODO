Fast User Switch Applet TODO:
=============================

----------------


[_] Better a11y support (widget labels, etc.).
[_] Fix testapp.

[_] Add link to a my-user-properties-style app (requires one be in GNOME).
[_] D-BUS (requires GDM support first).


----------------


What needs to be done:

1.) Memory usage is outta control.
2.) The socket to GDM would be better done as a non-blocking socket
instead of the gdmcomm.[c,h] stuff in a thread (done because it required
    no changes to the already-working gdmcomm).
3.) [-- done --]
4.) GDM needs some way to start the login procedure for a user (without
  breaking PAM), so it works like every other FUS method ever.

Blue-sky:

1.) *DM + DBUS = Luv
2.) Liboobs (the forthcoming GObject-based backend for the
  gnome-system-tools) may or may not have a way to monitor the system's
users for changes (e.g. some backend-agnostic way to tell when libnss-*
    has a new user or shell to add to the menu).
3.) [Your "it helps me work later hours, so I can by more" crackrock
idea here].
