    This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
    scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
    Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
    JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
    is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
