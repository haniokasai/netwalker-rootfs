Upgrade notifier tray icon
--------------------------

This is a small tray icon that backgrounds itself and checks for
upgrades. It must be ensured by other means (like a cron job) that a
regular "apt-get update" is done. This is ensured by installing a
option into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d to trigger a cron update script. It
uses FAM to monitor /var/lib/apt/lists/* and
/var/lib/update-notifier/dpkg-run-stamp. If they change it updates
it's status.

Needs libgnomeui2.0-dev and libhal-dev to build and gksu to run.

It also supports interactive hooks and reboot notification support,
see HOOKS for details. 

It will detect if a new distribution CD is inserted and supports addon 
CDs. 

Additionally it has grown avahi and crash report collection
support. Both very ubuntu specific.

Based on ideas of Matt Zimmerman und Jeff Waught. Tray example from
Lukas Lipka <lukas@pmad.net>. Lot's of cleanups from Michiel Sikkes.
Thanks!
