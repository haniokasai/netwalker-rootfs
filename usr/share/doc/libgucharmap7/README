This is the README for gucharmap.

gucharmap is a featureful unicode character map.


COMPILING

gucharmap uses GTK+ 2.6 or later, which you can get from
http://gtk.org/. 

If GNOME is available, gucharmap uses it, but only to make the Help
menu.

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install

There are two extra ./configure options:

  --disable-gnome disables GNOME-only functionality, even if the GNOME
    libraries are found. 

  --disable-unihan disables CJK ideograph information. The ideograph
    information includes definition and pronunciations in several
    languages, and is extracted from [3]. Omitting the ideograph
    information will reduce gucharmap's size by roughly 2 megabytes.
