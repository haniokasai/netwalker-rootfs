Until the kernel's crashdump helper semantics is changed to produce
core dumps, this library can be preloaded to emulate the kernel
behaviour. Right now, apport cannot put stack traces and core dumps
into crash reports if being called by the kernel.

ATTENTION: This library uses unsafe temporary file handling and must
NOT be used on production systems!

To use this library, do the following steps:

1. Disable the kernel crash handler:
 sudo /etc/init.d/apport stop
 
2. Build the library:

 cp -r /usr/share/doc/apport/examples apportlib
 cd apportlib
 make

3. Adjust permissions of /var/crash to be world-writable:

 sudo chmod 1777 /var/crash

  With the preload approach, apport does not have permission to write
  into the default /var/crash directory, so this adjustment is
  necessary to allow apport to create reports in the right place.

4. Enable preloading for the current shell:

 export LD_PRELOAD=`pwd`/libapport.so:$LD_PRELOAD 

  Alternatively, you can also add the path to /etc/ld.so.preload to
  have it become active for *all* programs. Above command will only
  activate the library for programs started from this shell.
