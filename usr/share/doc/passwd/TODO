ALL:
- move base passwd/shadow/group/gshadow operation to module for allow write
  different backend modules for db, NIS, LDAP and others. Default backend it
  will be goot if will be chosen depending on /etc/nsswitch.conf and allow
  override this by -r <repository> options (where the <repository> can be
  file, db, nis nisplus, ldap .. like on /etc/nsswitch.conf in service column).
  passwd have old piece of code with handling -r option and it will be good
  finish this and propagate on other shadow tools for allow operate on other
  user databases by well known tools.

- useradd:
  - add handle create user mail spool in maildir format.

- add handle -n switch in groups and id command for allow query is
  group/user with specified id/gid exist - this will be very usable
  on automation in packages for query/check is group/user exist in system
  or not,
