Notes for anyone wanting to build Debian packages of ttf-arabeyes.

  - Because of a bug in CDBS, I had to add a DEB_ARCH="all" instruction
    in debian/rules. Otherwise, ttf-arabeyes-udeb_$version_all.udeb
    would have been called ttf-arabeyes-udeb_$version_$arch.udeb even if
    Architecture: all
