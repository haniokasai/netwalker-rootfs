    The person or persons who have associated work with this document
    (the "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the
    best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public
    domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby
    dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of 
    authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier,
    moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated
    work, and for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.
    
    A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of
    this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
    him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public
    domain.
    
    Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and
    to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends
    this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
    present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or
    contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of
    all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit
    or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.
    
    Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may
    be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon,
    or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or
    non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been
    invented or conceived.
