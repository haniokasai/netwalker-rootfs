GObject and GtkAssistant based utility that splits the configuration of
a new mobile broadband connection into small easy steps. In the simplest

Runtime dependencies
====================

Although these packages are not required at build time they are required for
correct runtime functionality:

	Mobile Broadband Service Provider Database:
	 - http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/mobile-broadband-provider-info
	bluez (-gnome):
	  - BlueZ is used for Bluetooth functionality and bluez-gnome package
	    contains some translations for Bluetooth page (not vital)


Other notes
===========
This package uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
variety of systems. While this is very nice for making usable
binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that
reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
specifying the ‘--disable-shared’ option to ‘configure’.
