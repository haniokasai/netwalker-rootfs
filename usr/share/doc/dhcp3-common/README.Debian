ISC DHCP for Debian
-------------------

This is the Debian-packaged version of the Internet Software Consortium
(ISC) DHCP package.

This release has full support for operation on multiple interfaces and needs
a 2.2.x or later kernel; the 2.0.x kernels are _not_ supported.

The sources of the ISC DHCP package produce the following Debian packages:

dhcp3-common: Files used by all the dhcp packages.
dhcp3-server: DHCP Server
dhcp3-client: A DHCP Client
dhcp3-client-udeb: Small DHCP client for debian-installer
dhcp3-relay: A DHCP Relay
dhcp3-dev: API for accessing and modifying the DHCP server and client state

If you get the following error when trying to run dhclient, dhcpd or
dhcrelay:

   Can't install packet filter program: Protocol not available
   exiting.

then you need to edit your linux kernel .config file, set CONFIG_FILTER=y,
and rebuild your kernel. See /usr/share/doc/dhcp3-server/README.gz for
more information.

PLEASE NOTE: Upon upgrading dhcp3-client, dhclient is NOT restarted. Therefore,
after upgrading, the version of dhclient running will still be from the
previous version of dhcp3-client that was installed.

Apparmor Profile
----------------
If your system uses apparmor, please note that the shipped enforcing profiles
for dhcp3-server and dhcp3-client work with the default installation, and
changes in your configuration may require changes to the installed apparmor
profile. Please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor before filing a
bug against this software.
