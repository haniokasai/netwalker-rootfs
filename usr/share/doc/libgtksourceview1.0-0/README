General Information
===================

This is version 1.8.5 of GtkSourceView. 

GtkSourceView is a text widget that extends the standard gtk+ 2.x 
text widget GtkTextView.

It improves GtkTextView by implementing syntax highlighting and other
features typical of a source code editor.

You can download the latest GtkSourceView tarball from the gnome ftp server:

    ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtksourceview

Discussion of GtkSourceView happens in the gnome-devtools@gnome.org
mailing list.  You can subscribe and get further information here:

Installation
============

GtkSourceView requires GTK+-2.8.x, libxml2 2.5.x and libgnomeprint 2.8.x.

Simple install procedure:

  % gzip -cd gtksourceview-1.8.5.tar.gz | tar xvf -    # unpack the sources
  % cd gtksourceview-1.8.5		   # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script
  % make				   # build gtksourceview
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			   # install gtksourceview

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.


Language spec files format
==========================

The Document Type Definition for the XML format used in .lang files is
located at gtksourceview/language-specs/language.dtd.

The format for regular expressions in the .lang files is the POSIX
Extended Regular Expression Syntax, plus GNU operators (word operators
and buffer operators).

There is a limit of 250 keywords in <keyword-list> elements.
Internally keyword lists generates a branched regular expression
(i.e. "a|b|c|...") and a bug in GNU libc produces stack corruption
(hence crashes the application) for more than 250 or so branches.

Longer lists will then be truncated to 250 keywords.  To work around
this, split your keyword list into smaller ones.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtksourceview). 
You will need to create an account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the GNOME program bug-buddy.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

Please check the bugzilla pages for the list of known bugs.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the problem the patch
fixes, and attach it to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form (use the -up options of GNU
diff and cvs) and should follow the coding style described in the
HACKING file.
