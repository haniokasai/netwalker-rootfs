If you want to use scim-bridge, I assume that you have installed relate
packages, like scim-bridge-agent, scim-bridge-client-{gtk,qt}. 
To use it, you shall set your corresponding environment variable, such
as, GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE. In most recently Debian/Ubuntu, if
you have im-switch installed, you can provide a configure file in 
~/.xinput.d/<ll_CC>, which contain as below:
##=================Begain============================================
    XIM=SCIM
    if [ -e /usr/bin/skim ]; then
        XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/skim
    else
        XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/scim
    fi
    XIM_ARGS="-d"
    GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge
    QT_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge
    DEPENDS="scim | skim, scim-bridge-agent, scim-bridge-client-gtk | scim-bridge-client-qt"
##=================End==============================================
You may open a terminal, and do: locale |grep LANGUAGE, then you will get
the value of ll_CC. In above configure file, we make GTK and Qt programs all
use scim-bridge, but you can decide whether to use them both.
