// This file defines the names of sections known by aptitude.  You can
// add new sections by adding new entries to the "Top-Sections" list

// this file to be selected by providing a translation for
// "aptitude-section-names" in the .po for your language.
//
// Due to bug #260446, double-quotes (") cannot be backslash-escaped.
// For this reason, aptitude treats adjacent pairs of apostrophese('')
// as double-quotes: that is, the string "''" in a section description
