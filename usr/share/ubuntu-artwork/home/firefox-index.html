  <p>The Ubuntu project is built on the ideas enshrined in the
  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/philosophy">Ubuntu philosophy</a>: that software should be available
  free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in
  their local language, and that people should have the freedom to
  customize and alter their software in whatever way they need.</p>

  <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Getting Help with
  Ubuntu:</h2>
