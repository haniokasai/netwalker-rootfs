# This file defines the common key bindings
#
# For a keybinding to live in the "common" area, it must be verified to
# work in at least:
#  * gnome-terminal
#  * console tty
#
# bindkey commands should be followed by a comment that will be used in the
# help file (one day).  The command should be formated as:
#   # <key> | explanation

# F-keys seem to work well in both gnome-terminal and tty consoles
							# F1  | 'help' in gnome-terminal
register n "^a^c^aA"					#     | Goes with the F2 definition
bindkey -k k2 process n					# F2  | Create new window (and name it)
bindkey -k k3 prev					# F3  | Previous Window
bindkey -k k4 next					# F4  | Next Window
register r "^a:source $HOME/.screen-profiles/profile"	#     | Goes with F5 definition
bindkey -k k5 process r					# F5  | Reload profile
bindkey -k k6 detach					# F6  | Detach from this session
bindkey -k k7 copy					# F7  | Enter copy/scrollback mode
bindkey -k k8 help					# F8  | Advanced help/keybindings
bindkey -k k9 screen -t help 0 screen-profiles		# F9  | Configuration
							# F10 | 'toolbar' in gnome-terminal
							# F11 | 'fullscreen' in gnome-terminal
bindkey -k F2 lockscreen				# F12 | Lock this terminal
