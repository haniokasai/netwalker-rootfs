*** Please submit non packaging issue (e.g. feature requests) bugs to
the Debian BTS and the upstream bugzilla
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox) and put a
reference to the bugzilla bug in the Debian bug report, to ease bug
triage for the maintainers. Thank you. ***

Firefox extensions being a big source of problems, please either try to
reproduce your bug with a clean user of with you current user in safe
mode, with the "firefox -safe-mode" command line before filing any bugs.
If your bug disappears with a clean user or in safe mode, you might want
to find which extension is responsible for it and file a bug to the
appropriate package, bug tracking system, or author.

Also, please try running firefox with MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO=1 set in your
environment to test with Pango rendering disabled, which can cause
problems in some cases.

If your Firefox installation pre-dates 1.0, you might have had problems
Firefox not really cleanly supporting upgrade from one release to another.
Please try moving around your ~/.mozilla/firefox directory to see if it
helps with your issue.

Firefox requires the loopback interface (lo) to be up and unfiltered
to accept keyboard input and function correctly. Please make sure this
is the case before filing any bugs.

If you get crashes and none of the above hints did avoid the crash, please
first try to remove plugins from the /usr/lib/firefox/plugins,
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins and ~/.mozilla/plugins directories.

If Firefox still crashes, please install the firefox-dbg package and run
firefox with gdb with the "firefox -g" command line. On the gdb prompt, type
the following commands:
set pagination off
run
bt full
And attach the resulting backtrace to your bug report.

If you are seeing XML parsing errors, please make sure you kill all
running Firefoxes and reload before filing any bugs.
