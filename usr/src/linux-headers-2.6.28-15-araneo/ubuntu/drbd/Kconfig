	  DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability
	  clusters.  This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
	  dedicated) network.  You could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  Each minor device has a state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the
	  local 'lower level block device' and via network to the node with the
	  device in 'secondary' state.
	  The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower level block
	  device. Currently no read-balancing via the network is done.

	  DRBD can also be used with "shared-disk semantics" (primary-primary),
	  even though it is a "shared-nothing cluster".  You'd need to use a
	  cluster file system on top of that for cache coherency.

	  DRBD management is done through user-space tools.
	  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).
