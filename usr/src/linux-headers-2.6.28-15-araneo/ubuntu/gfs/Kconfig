	  A cluster filesystem.

	  Allows a cluster of computers to simultaneously use a block device
	  that is shared between them (with FC, iSCSI, NBD, etc...).  GFS reads
	  and writes to the block device like a local filesystem, but also uses
	  a lock module to allow the computers coordinate their I/O so
	  filesystem consistency is maintained.  One of the nifty features of
	  GFS is perfect consistency -- changes made to the filesystem on one
	  machine show up immediately on all other machines in the cluster.

	  To use the GFS filesystem, you will need to enable one or more of
	  the below locking modules. Documentation and utilities for GFS can
	  be found here: http://sources.redhat.com/cluster
