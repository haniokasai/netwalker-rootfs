=head1 NAME

Glib::Param::Int - Paramspecs for integer types

=for object Glib::Param::Int - Paramspecs for integer types

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page documents the extra accessors available for all of the integer type
paramspecs: Char, Int, and Long.  Perl really only supports full-size integers,
so all of these methods return IVs; the distinction of integer size is
important to the underlying C library and also determines the data value range.
