=head1 NAME

Glib::Param::UInt -  Wrapper for uint parameters in GLib

=for object Glib::Param::UInt Wrapper for uint parameters in GLib

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page documents the extra accessors available for all of the unsigned
integer type paramspecs: UChar, UInt, and ULong.  Perl really only supports
full-size integers, so all of these methods return UVs; the distinction of
integer size is important to the underlying C library and also determines the
data value range.
