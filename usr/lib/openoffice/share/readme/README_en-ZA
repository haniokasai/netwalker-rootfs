Shortcut Keys
------------------------------------------------------------

Only shortcut keys (key combinations) not used by the operating system can be used in OpenOffice.org. If a key combination in OpenOffice.org does not work as described in the OpenOffice.org Help, check if that shortcut is already used by the operating system. To rectify such conflicts, you can change the keys assigned by your operating system. Alternatively, you can change almost any key assignment in OpenOffice.org. For more information on this topic, refer to the OpenOffice.org Help or the Help documentation of your operating system.



------------------------------------------------------------
File Locking
------------------------------------------------------------

In the default setting, file locking is turned on in OpenOffice.org. To deactivate it, you have to set the appropriate environment variables SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING=0 and export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING. These entries are already in enabled form in the soffice script file.

Warning: The activated file locking feature can cause problems with Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.7 used in conjunction with Linux NFS 2.0. If your system environment has these parameters, we strongly recommend that you avoid using the file locking feature. Otherwise, OpenOffice.org will hang when you try to open a file from a NFS mounted directory from a Linux computer.
