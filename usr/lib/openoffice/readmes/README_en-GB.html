<P>Dear User</P>
<P>This file contains important information about this program. Please read this information very carefully before starting work.</P>
<P>The OpenOffice.org Community, responsible for the development of this product, would like to invite you to participate as a community member. As a new user, you can check out the OpenOffice.org site with helpful user information at </P>
<P><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/about_us/introduction.html%20">http://www.openoffice.org/about_us/introduction.html </a></P>
<P>Also read the sections below about getting involved in the OpenOffice.org project. </P>
<H3>Is OpenOffice.org really free for any user? </H3>
<P>OpenOffice.org is free for use by everybody. You may take this copy of OpenOffice.org and install it on as many computers as you like, and use it for any purpose you like (including commercial, government, public administration and educational use). For further details see the license text delivered together with OpenOffice.org or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/license.html%20">http://www.openoffice.org/license.html </a>
</P>
<H3>Why is OpenOffice.org free for any user?</H3>
<P>You can use this copy of OpenOffice.org today free of charge because individual contributors and corporate sponsors have designed, developed, tested, translated, documented, supported, marketed, and helped in many other ways to make OpenOffice.org what it is today - the world's leading open-source office software.If you appreciate their efforts, and would like to ensure OpenOffice.org continues into the future, please consider contributing to the project - see <a href="http://contributing.openoffice.org">http://contributing.openoffice.org</a> for details. Everyone has a contribution to make.</P>
<H2>Notes on Installation</H2>
<P>System Requirements:</P>
<P><ul type="circle">
<li>Linux Kernel version 2.2.13 or higher</li>
<li>glibc2 version 2.2.4 or higher</li>
<li>gtk version 2.2.0 or higher</li>
<li>Pentium compatible PC</li>
<li>64 MB RAM</li>
<li>400 MB (Chinese, Japanese and Korean versions: 550 MB, multi-language version: 900 MB) available hard disc space</li>
<li>Chinese, Japanese and Korean versions: 440 MB available hard disk space</li>
<li>X Server with 800x600 or higher resolution, with at least 256 colours</li>
<li>Window Manager</li>
<li>Gnome 2.0 or higher required for Assistive Technology Tools</li>
</ul></P>
<P>There is a wide variety of Linux distributions, and even within the same distribution there may be different installation options (KDE vs Gnome, etc.). Some distributions ship with their own ‘native’ version of OpenOffice.org, which may have different features from this Community OpenOffice.org. Sometimes you can install the Community OpenOffice.org alongside the ‘native’ version. However, it’s usually safer to remove the ‘native’ version before installing this Community version. Consult the documentation for your distribution for details of how to do this. </P>
<P>It is recommended that you always backup your system before you remove or install software.</P>
<H3>Problems During Program Startup</H3>
<P>If you experience OpenOffice.org startup problems (most notably while using Gnome) please 'unset' the SESSION_MANAGER environment variable inside the shell you use to start OpenOffice.org. This can be done by adding the line "unset SESSION_MANAGER" to the beginning of the soffice shell script found in the "[office folder]/program" directory.</P>
<P>Difficulties starting OpenOffice.org (e.g. applications hang) as well as problems with the screen display are often caused by the graphics card driver. If these problems occur, please update your graphics card driver or try using the graphics driver delivered with your operating system. Difficulties displaying 3D objects can often be solved by deactivating the option "Use OpenGL" under 'Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - View - 3D view'.</P>
<P>Please note that copy and paste via clipboard between OpenOffice.org 1.x and OpenOffice.org 3.0 might not work in OpenOffice.org format. If that happens, choose 'Edit - Paste Special' and choose a format other than OpenOffice.org, or open the document in OpenOffice.org 3.0 directly.</P>
<P>Please make sure you have enough free memory in the temporary directory on your system and that read, write and run access rights have been granted. Close all other programs before starting the installation.</P>
<H3>Shortcut Keys</H3>
<P>Only shortcut keys (key combinations) not used by the operating system can be used in OpenOffice.org. If a key combination in OpenOffice.org does not work as described in the OpenOffice.org Help, check if that shortcut is already used by the operating system. To rectify such conflicts, you can change the keys assigned by your operating system. Alternatively, you can change almost any key assignment in OpenOffice.org. For more information on this topic, refer to the OpenOffice.org Help or the Help documentation of your operating system.</P>
<P>Due to a conflict with input method switching on multiple platforms, the following shortcut keys required to be changed at last minute:</P>
<P><ul type="circle">
<li>Ctrl-Space is now Ctrl-Shift-Space</li>
<li>Ctrl-Shift-Space is now Ctrl-M</li>
</ul></P>
<H3>File Locking</H3>
<P>In the default setting, file locking is turned on in OpenOffice.org. To deactivate it, you have to set the appropriate environment variables SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING=0 and export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING. These entries are enabled in the soffice script file.</P>
<P>Warning: The activated file locking feature can cause problems with Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.7 used in conjunction with Linux NFS 2.0. If your system environment has these parameters, we strongly recommend that you avoid using the file locking feature. Otherwise, OpenOffice.org will hang when you try to open a file from a NFS mounted directory on a Linux computer.</P>
