# This is the configuration file for the keymouselistener.so module.
# The confiuration syntax is as follows:
#
#   crossing inital_direction timeout executable_path +args
#
# For executable_path give the full executable path path of the program or the
# DefaultPath is used.
#
# where:
#
# + crossing is a string that includes any combination of TBLR characters, where
#   T means Top, B means Bottom, L means Left, and R means Right.
#
# + initial_direction can be either the I or O character which indicates
#   that the initial crossing is a motion In or Out of the window.
# 
# e.g.
# TBLR I 10000    /usr/bin/gok --login --access-method=dwellselection
#
# Means the user crosses into the top border, out the bottom border, into the left
# border, and then out the right border (in that order).  The initial_direction
# value of I is what specifies that the first crossing is into the top border
# rather than out of the top border.  Each border crossing must occur within
# 10000ms of the last border crossing for the gesture to be valid.
#
# It is possible to invoke multiple actions from a single gesture using the <Add>
# keyword.  Action specified with <Add> are invoked by the previous gesture
# defined in the file.  If the <Add> action is the first action defined in the
# file, then it is ignored.
#
# e.g.
#
# <Add>           /usr/bin/orca -n -d main-window
#

# AT Progarm - GOK (GNOME On-screen Keyboard)
#
# Support several different options for different user needs.  Note these
# gestures all start by moving the mouse into the top window border.
