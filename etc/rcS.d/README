The scripts in this directory whose names begin with an 'S' are executed
once when booting the system, even when booting directly into single user
mode.

The scripts are all symbolic links whose targets are located in
/etc/init.d/ .

To disable a script in this directory, rename it so that it begins with
a 'K'.

For more information see /etc/init.d/README.

The following sequence points are defined at this time:

* After the S40 scripts have executed, all local file systems are mounted
  and networking is available. All device drivers have been initialized.

* After the S60 scripts have executed, the system clock has been set, NFS
  filesystems have been mounted (unless the system depends on the automounter,
  which is started later) and the filesystems have been cleaned.
