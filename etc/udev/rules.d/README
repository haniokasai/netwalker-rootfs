The files in this directory are read by udev(7) and used when events
are performed by the kernel.  The udev daemon watches this directory
with inotify so that changes to these files are automatically picked
up, for this reason they must be files and not symlinks to another
location as in the case in Debian.

Packages do not generally install rules here, this directory is for
local rules.  If you want to override behaviour of package-supplied
rules, which can be found in /lib/udev/rules.d, you can do one of
two things:

 1) Write your own rules in this directory that assign the name,
    symlinks, permissions, etc. that you want.  Pick a number higher
    than the rules you want to override, and yours will be used.

 2) Copy the file from /lib/udev/rules.d and edit it here; you
    should generally only do this if you want to prevent a program
    from being run.


Files should be named xx-descriptive-name.rules, the xx should be
chosen first according to the following sequence points:

 < 60  most user rules; if you want to prevent an assignment being
       overriden by default rules, use the := operator.

       these cannot access persistent information such as that from
       vol_id

 < 70  rules that run helpers such as vol_id to populate the udev db

 < 90  rules that run other programs (often using information in the
       udev db)

 >=90  rules that should run last
