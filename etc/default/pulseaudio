# Start the PulseAudio sound server in system mode.
# (enables the pulseaudio init script - requires that users be in the
# pulse-access group)
# System mode is not the recommended way to run PulseAudio as it has some
# limitations (such as no shared memory access) and could potentially allow
# users to disconnect or redirect each others' audio streams. The
# recommended way to run PulseAudio is as a per-session daemon. For GNOME
# sessions in Ubuntu, /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70pulseaudio and
# /usr/bin/pulse-session handle this function of automatically starting 
# PulseAudio on login. For other sessions, you can simply start PulseAudio
# with "pulseaudio --daemonize".
# 0 = don't start, 1 = start
PULSEAUDIO_SYSTEM_START=0

# Prevent users from dynamically loading modules into the PulseAudio sound
# server. Dynamic module loading enhances the flexibilty of the PulseAudio
# system, but may pose a security risk.
# 0 = no, 1 = yes
